<p>Within a space settlement we must control the atmosphere to certain specifications for optimal
  functioning of the inhabitants; most importantly, the human ones. What are these specifications?
  We must consider the settlement atmosphere’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>temperature</li>
  <li>pressure</li>
  <li>composition</li>
</ul>

<p>Terran air has a pressure of 101.325 kPa. The dry atmosphere has a composition as follows:</p>

<p>Added to this dry atmosphere is a component of water vapour, which varies from 0.001% to 5%,
  depending on climate and region.</p>

<p>However, we don’t necessarily need a settlement atmosphere that exactly matches Terran air.
  Humans and other organisms can operate within a range of temperatures and pressures, as long as
  the atmosphere contains sufficient amounts of the necessary ingredients.</p>

<h2>Temperature</h2>

<p>In terms of comfort and productivity, what is the optimal temperature for humans?</p>

<p>Scientific standards for Terran atmosphere include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure: 298.15 K (25 °C, 77 °F) and an absolute pressure of
    100 kPa.
  </li>
  <li>Normal Temperature and Pressure: 293.15 K (20 °C, 68 °F) and absolute pressure of 101.325 kPa.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines “room temperature” as around 20
  to 22 °C (68 to 72 °F).</p>

<p>The West Midlands Public Health Observatory has provided these figures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 °C - top range of comfort</li>
  <li>21 °C - recommended living room temperature</li>
  <li>18 °C - recommended bedroom temperature</li>
  <li>16 °C - resistance to respiratory diseases weakened</li>
  <li>12 °C - more than two hours at this temperature raises blood pressure and increases heart
    attack and stroke risk
  </li>
  <li>5 °C - significant risk of hypothermia</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people like it a little warm, and some like it a little cool. This can depend on where the
  person comes from, their metabolism, or simply personal preference. We must choose a temperature
  range such that the maximum number of people will feel comfortable and productive, since we’re
  designing settlements for people who could come from anywhere on Earth. If it’s too different for
  them, in terms of temperature or anything else, then at least it should not be too difficult to
  adapt. In other words, it should not be too cold, nor too hot, but just right.</p>

<p>Given these values and considerations, we probably want to control the internal temperature to a
  range of about 20 to 25 °C in order for most people to feel comfortable.</p>

<h3><i>Idea</i></h3>

<p>We could map the temperature of the surrounding lunar or Martian environment to the temperature
  of the settlement atmosphere using a simple linear equation. The maximum temperature outside would
  correspond to 25 °C inside, and the minimum temperature outside would correspond to 20 °C inside.
  We would measure the external temperature constantly, and provide that data to the ECLSS computer,
  which would then calculate a corresponding internal temperature and adjust accordingly using
  heaters or air conditioners as required.</p>

<p>To illustrate, let’s say that Enterprise is located at a place on Mars where the temperature
  varies between -90 °C and -10 °C. The internal temperature (Ti) would be calculated from the
  external temperature (Te) as follows:</p>

<div class="math">
  <p>Ti = 0.0625 Te + 25.625 °C</p>
</div>

<p>The ECLSS would modify the internal temperature to match the calculated value, thus the internal
  temperature would reflect the external temperature, and everyone would be able to feel it.</p>

<p>The temperature would vary in a noticeable yet not uncomfortable manner during the course of the
  Martian day and year, in sync with Mars’ diurnal and seasonal cycles (or in the case of Luna, with
  the monthly cycle). This will give us a direct sensory experience of what the temperature is like
  outside. We will know when it is a warm day or a cool night at our little spot on Luna or Mars.
  This will connect us with our adopted world in a very tangible way, and we will begin adapting to
  its cycles. Also, we will have something to talk about: the weather.</p>

<p>We could use a different equation within an isolated greenhouse, in order to simulate, for
  example, a temperate environment with seasons of similar temperature as on Earth, but having
  Martian duration. In this way, temperate zone crops could be trained to adapt to Mars’ longer
  seasons.</p>

<p>One thing we must consider, however, is that when the internal temperature is high, the
  atmosphere will expand, which will tend to increase the internal pressure. This may be undesirable
  depending , We may not want this. However, we can control the internal pressure using pumps that
  add or remove nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour as required. We need these
  anyway, because other processes will also cause gas partial pressures to change, and we need to
  maintain them at the correct desired levels.</p>

<p>This idea could be applied to greenhouses, with different temperature ranges. Other metrics such
  as the humidity and pressure outside could potentially also be mapped to the internal environment,
  which would connect the plants more with Mars. In tropical greenhouses, the climate does not need
  to vary greatly, but in temperate greenhouses, we may want to simulate an internal climate that
  tracks the external climate throughout the year, such that the plants and other species will begin
  to adapt to the longer Martian seasons.</p>

<h2>Pressure</h2>

<p>A settlement on Luna or Mars must contain pressurised gas at a pressure approximately 100 kPa
  higher than the external environment. The air inside will therefore be pushing hard against the
  outer walls, floors and ceilings of the settlement. A space settlement is similar to a submarine
  in that it must have a strong outer skin, essentially a hull, to contain the pressurised air. The
  difference is that, with a space settlement, the external pressure is much lower than the internal
  pressure, instead of much higher. The air inside is pushing strongly outwards against the hull,
  instead of the water outside pushing strongly inwards. Like a submarine hull, the settlement hull
  will need to be strong enough to contain the air inside without bursting, or leaking too much.</p>

<p>Historically, two main options have been used when it comes to spacecraft and space station
  atmospheres:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A lower-pressure atmosphere, comprising either pure oxygen or some combination of oxygen and
    nitrogen.
  </li>
  <li>An Earthlike atmosphere of about 101 kPa, comprising about 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using an Earthlike atmosphere has a couple of specific advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No prebreathing required is when transferring from Earth atmosphere to the spacecraft.</li>
  <li>Equipment designed for an Earthlike atmosphere is more likely to work as expected in the
    spacecraft. It therefore becomes easier to use COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) hardware, which
    saves money on development costs. Also, it’s much easier to test equipment on Earth if it’s
    expected to work in an Earthlike atmosphere in space, because the testing can be done in a
    workshop, laboratory, someone’s backyard, or wherever; otherwise, a hypobaric chamber is needed.
  </li>
  <li>A high percentage of buffer gas greatly reduces the risk of fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these advantages, an Earthlike atmosphere probably isn’t optimal for a settlement on Luna
  or Mars. There are several very good reasons for designing a settlement atmosphere with a lower
  pressure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Less material is required for the settlement hull to successfully contain the atmosphere. It
    will leak less, and be less likely to pop.
  </li>
  <li>Less air needs to be made, saving energy and time.</li>
  <li>A lower pressure makes it possible to avoid the need for prebreathing (explained below) before
    using spacesuits, which we will want to do whenever we want to go outside on Luna or Mars, which
    presumably many people will want to do, and potentially quite often. Not having to prebreathe
    saves time, and reduces the risk of decompression sickness. This is called a <i>zero prebreathe
      protocol</i>.
  </li>
  <li>For Mars, another reason is to more closely match the atmospheric pressure on a terraformed
    Mars, which is likely to be much lower than Earth’s.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s look at each of these points.</p>

<h3>Less material is required</h3>

<p>The main reason for building spacecraft and space stations with low-pressure atmospheres is that
  it means the pressurised modules won’t need to be as strong as if they were designed for a full
  atmosphere of pressure, which means less material is needed, which means the modules are lighter,
  which means they’re cheaper to manufacture and to launch into space.</p>

<p>This reasoning is still valid for lunar and Martian settlements. The pressurised structures that
  we build will have to contain the atmosphere against a very low external pressure. In a sense they
  will be like a balloon, with air pressing outwards on the walls. This is another big advantage of
  building underground, as the surrounding rock will be strong enough to contain the internal
  atmospheric pressure. However, even if the settlement is mostly located underground and encased in
  rock, there will still be doors, windows, skylights, greenhouses, domes, and so on, that need to
  be strong enough to contain the internal atmospheric pressure. The lower this pressure, the easier
  and cheaper it will be to manufacture these items.</p>

<p>Also consider that the lower the atmospheric pressure inside a container, the less likely that it
  will burst, and the less it will leak. While we will design for zero leaks in the settlement hull,
  some leakage is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Less air to make</h3>

<p>For safety, we must be able to make our own air on Luna and Mars. Some air will gradually be lost
  from the system due to recycling inefficiencies, airlocks, and tiny leaks, and we will have to
  constantly replace this lost gas. On the ISS, this replacement gas comes from nitrogen and oxygen
  tanks that are shipped up from Earth. In Serenity and Enterprise, we will also top up the
  settlement’s atmosphere form nitrogen and oxygen tanks, but we will need to fill these tanks using
  local resources. That is, after all, the whole point of settling a world rather than somewhere
  free space. In this way we can be more self-reliant, and our survival will be more assured.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mars has plenty of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Luna also has plenty of
  oxygen as oxides and in water ice, and nitrogen in the form of ammonia ice. In either case,
  producing breathable air will cost energy, time, and therefore also money. If the settlement
  atmosphere is 53 kPa instead of 101 kPa, that’s literally a 47% savings on all these resources
  whenever we need to inflate an extension to the settlement.</p>

<h3>Zero Prebreathe Protocol</h3>

<p>There is a second good reason to minimise space settlement atmospheric pressure, which is the
  opportunity for a <i>zero prebreathe protocol</i>.</p>

<p>To explain. Gas pressurised spacesuits, like the classic Apollo and ISS spacesuits, are
  essentially rigid balloons, and it’s difficult to move around in them. I asked the astronaut Andy
  Thomas what it was like, repairing the Hubble, and he said matter-of-factly: “Well, it was very
  hard work!” Using the gloves is like constantly squeezing a tennis ball. Not only is this
  difficult and fatiguing, it also compromises dexterity, making it difficult to grip things and
  easy to drop them. The stiffness of the suit also makes it difficult to bend over, which someone
  may want to do quite often when working or exploring outside on Luna or Mars.</p><img
  alt="Gas pressurised spacesuits" data-align="center"
  data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Gas pressurised spacesuits&lt;/em&gt;" data-entity-type="file"
  data-entity-uuid="7f08f9d7-7284-4cd8-bb0f-156404c086d3"
  src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/gas-pressurised-spacesuits.png"/><p>To minimise this
  problem, spacesuit atmospheres are designed to have very low pressure, usually comprising pure
  oxygen.</p>

<p>Transferring from high to low pressure environments can cause bubbles of nitrogen to form in the
  blood; a condition called decompression sickness, also known as “the bends”. This commonly occurs
  when underwater divers ascend too quickly. To counteract this effect, they ascend in stages,
  waiting for a period of time at set depths on their way up, so that their bodies can adjust to the
  reduced pressure. Preparing for a deep dive means calculating in advance the depths at which the
  divers should wait on the way back up, and how long to wait for.</p>

<p>The pressure differential between the spacecraft and a spacesuit means that the astronauts can be
  at risk of decompression sickness when they use the spacesuits. Therefore, before doing so, they
  will often spend a period of time breathing pure oxygen in order to remove the nitrogen from their
  blood. This is called <i>prebreathing</i>, and it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours.
</p>

<p>The amount of prebreathing necessary is determined by a quantity called the <i>R value</i>, which
  is the ratio between the partial pressure of buffer gas (usually nitrogen) in the spacecraft, and
  the total pressure in the spacesuit. If this ratio is 1 (i.e. the pressures are the same), then no
  prebreathing is required; hence the term “zero prebreathe protocol”. If we can achieve this design
  goal then we’ll be able to go outside as often as we like, without any risk of getting the bends.
  If the R value is greater than 1, however, then prebreathing will be required. Aside from the
  wasted time, there would also be a risk of decompression sickness regardless, because this risk is
  cumulative; it increases with every EVA.</p>

<p>An R value of 1 is therefore an important design goal for Serenity and Enterprise. Let’s consider
  a person that wants to go outside once a week, for about 50 years (or 27 Martian years) of their
  life; this is a total of 2500 EVAs! Now consider that Luna and Mars settlers might live for
  centuries, and some might want or need to go outside every day. We have to expect that some
  settlers may wish to go outside literally thousands of times during their time on Luna or Mars,
  and we have to design for that. Since risk of decompression is present with an R value greater
  than 1, and is cumulative, our design goal must be an R value of 1. Therefore, <i>the spacesuit
    oxygen pressure must match the buffer gas pressure in the settlement</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a new type of spacesuit being developed called a <i>mechanical
  counter-pressure</i> (MCP) spacesuit. These are skintight, like a diver’s wetsuit. Pressure is
  applied to the wearer from the tight, elastic material, rather than from gas as in a conventional
  gas pressurised spacesuit. This makes for a suit which is much easier to move around in.</p>

<p>In an MCP spacesuit, we don’t need to minimise the air pressure as much. One of the latest
  designs, the Biosuit developed by MIT, will have a pressure around 35 kPa. As we shall see, this
  is perfect. This value closely matches the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere design proposed
  below, which gives us an R value of 1, and thus a zero prebreathe protocol.</p><img
  alt="Dava Newman modelling the Biosuit by MIT" data-align="center"
  data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Dava Newman modelling the Biosuit by MIT&lt;/em&gt;"

  src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/dava-newman-biosuit.png"/><h3>Atmospheric pressure on
  terraformed Mars</h3>

<p>When we terraform Mars it’s unlikely that we will attempt to create a full 101 kPa of pressure at
  sea level on Mars. This is because of the planet’s low gravity, which causes air to weigh less and
  thus produce less pressure. We need significantly more gas in the atmosphere to produce an
  atmospheric pressure equal to Earth’s. To create Earth-level atmospheric pressure would require
  about 2.6 times the mass of atmosphere per square metre compared with Earth, because on Mars a
  given mass only weighs 38% as much.</p>

<p>If we attempt to build such a massive atmosphere, it would reach actually higher than Phobos.</p>

<p>It will also be much cheaper to build a lower pressure atmosphere. Building Mars’ atmosphere will
  be an enormous engineering project, involving advanced space technology and the efforts of many
  scientists and engineers over a period decades. If insufficient nitrogen can be found on Mars with
  which to build the target atmosphere, then we may have to import it from Venus, Titan, or
  asteroids. Meeting these requirements will undoubtedly cost billions of sollars (Solar System
  Dollars).</p>

<p>Creating an atmospheric pressure of 53 kPa (which, as we’ll see, is approximately the minimum
  safe total pressure) will require 1.4 times the mass of atmosphere per square metre as on Earth.
  Even this will be extremely difficult.</p>

<p>As the terraforming project produces niches where Terran people, plants, and animals can live, it
  will be advantageous if the new atmosphere matches the settlement atmosphere that they’ve already
  adapted to.</p>

<h2>Composition</h2>

<p>To support the various things living in it, the settlement atmosphere must contain a mixture of
  nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. It will contain traces of many other gases as
  well, but these are the four main ones we care about.</p>

<p>With a design goal of minimising the atmospheric pressure while preserving maximum health and
  safety, we can calculate the optimal partial pressures of each of these gases.</p>

<h3>Oxygen</h3>

<p>To minimise the total atmospheric pressure in the settlement, we begin with minimising the oxygen
  pressure.</p>

<p>The minimum desirable oxygen partial pressure is about 16 kPa. This is approximately what you’ll
  find in a passenger airplane, or at about 2400 metres altitude. Most people can ascend to this
  altitude without any problems, although, above this altitude, some people will start showing signs
  of altitude sickness. It’s perfectly possible to acclimatise to lower pressures, and many people
  live above this altitude. However, we don’t want people arriving at the settlement from Earth and
  immediately getting altitude sickness, hence 16 kPa is a good minimum.</p>

<p>Another constraint is that, to mitigate fire risk, we want an oxygen partial pressure no greater
  than roughly 30% of the total atmospheric pressure. In a high oxygen atmosphere it’s easier for
  fires to start. This was the cause of the Apollo 1 fire.</p>

<p>The Apollo crew modules originally had high-pressure 100% oxygen atmospheres for when they were
  on the launch pad. During a test with the Apollo 1 astronauts in the capsule, on the launch pad, a
  fire started in the cabin. Unfortunately the crew could not escape, and died. The Apollo crew
  capsule was subsequently redesigned with a different atmosphere for when it was on the launch pad,
  with 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen. Nitrogen has the effect of diluting oxygen, and reducing the
  risk of fire.</p>

<p>If the desired oxygen pressure is 16 kPa (lowest reasonable safe value), and we specify this to
  be 30% of the total atmospheric pressure, we can calculate the total pressure:</p>

<div class="math">
  <p>16 kPa / 30% = 53.33 kPa</p>
</div>

<p>This is just over half the standard pressure at sea level on Earth.</p>

<p>Some experimentation is necessary to determine the precise effect this will have on gas exchange
  rates in plants. The low air pressure, and in particular the low partial pressures of carbon
  dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen, may affect crop growth rates. However, it’s known that plants can
  grow in one-tenth of an atmosphere (about 10 kPa), and some space greenhouses are designed for low
  pressures like this.</p>

<p>It’s fortunate that we are able to design a safe atmosphere for the settlements that has a much
  lower pressure than Earth’s, because less gas, time, money and energy will be required to inflate
  new sections of the settlement build the atmosphere, plus the various health and safety
  benefits.</p>

<h3>Carbon dioxide</h3>

<p>Humans don’t need carbon dioxide to breathe, but we’ll be sharing our quarters with plants, which
  do. Even if we create separate, sealed environments for greenhouses and farm modules, we will
  still probably want some indoor plants about the place to make it look nice.</p>

<p>Fortunately, they don’t need much. While plants grow faster when there’s more CO<sub>2</sub> in
  the air, humans start to get drowsy when concentrations reach about 1%. Symptoms worsen with
  increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p><img alt="CO2 toxicity" data-align="center"
  data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4ece0d85-a261-407b-9b73-6433f8fd0309"
  src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/co2-toxicity.png"/><p>It’s typical to maintain a maximum
  CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in spacecraft atmospheres of about 5000 ppm (0.5%). However, while
  this may be tolerable for trained astronauts, this will be too high for civilians.</p>

<p>We need to keep CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations low enough that it doesn’t bother us, but high
  enough that plants can absorb it from the air. Terran atmosphere currently contains about 400 ppm
  CO<sub>2</sub>, however, for all of human history prior to the Industrial Revolution it ranged
  between about 180 and 280 ppm, so we know these levels are plenty for healthy plants.</p>

<p>Indoor concentrations tend to be higher, depending on the level of ventilation. Organisations
  such as ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) and
  OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) specify a maximum level of 1000 ppm for areas
  like classrooms and conference rooms, and a maximum of 5000 ppm for up to 8 hours.</p>

<p>However, anything above about 600 ppm can become uncomfortable, and many people will be living in
  this atmosphere 24.66 hours per sol, 7 sols per Martian week.</p>

<p>More CO<sub>2</sub> means healthier plants, but we wish for everyone to feel comfortable indoors.
  Therefore, we should probably aim to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels around 500 ppm. Our target
  atmosphere will therefore include about:</p>

<div class="math">
  <p>53.33 kPa * 500 ppm = 0.03 kPa of CO<sub>2</sub></p>
</div>

<h3>Water vapour</h3>

<p>Terran air contains a little water vapour, which our respiration and perspiration systems are
  adapted to. We require some water vapour in the air because overly dry air can cause dry skin and
  respiratory issues.</p>

<p>Plants like it, too. Water vapour condenses on their leaves, and sinks into the soil where it can
  be taken up by the roots.</p>

<p>The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is expressed as humidity, a percentage value that
  ranges from 0% (totally dry) to 100% (saturated). In a desert it may be 0% humidity or close to
  it. In a steamy, tropical rainforest or a jungle, or when it’s raining, the humidity is 100%. Low
  humidity makes you feel cooler, and high humidity makes you feel hotter.</p>

<p>NASA specifies a humidity in the range of 30 - 70% inside spacecraft, which is a comfortable
  range. The optimal range is around 45 - 55%. Saturation pressure varies with temperature. At 22.5
  °C, which will be the average temperature inside the settlement, the saturated vapour pressure
  will be 2.73 kPa. For a target humidity of 50%, our atmosphere will therefore include about:</p>

<div class="math">
  <p>2.73 kPa * 50% = 1.37 kPa of H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</div>

<h3>Nitrogen and argon</h3>

<p>Nitrogen and argon have the effect of diluting atmospheric oxygen, which makes combustion
  reactions more difficult, thus reducing the possibility of fire hazards. For this reason they are
  referred to as buffer gases. In spacecraft atmospheres, only nitrogen is used for buffer gas. In
  Earth’s atmosphere the buffer gases comprise about 99% nitrogen and 1% argon.</p>

<p>Nitrogen will probably be the only buffer gas in lunar settlements, because it will be much
  easier to source than argon. There is a tiny bit of argon in the lunar atmosphere and a tiny bit
  in the regolith, but the polar cold traps, which we will mine for water, contain nitrogen in the
  form of ammonia ice.</p>

<p>In Martian settlements we may wish to include argon in our buffer gas, as it's present in the
  atmosphere in approximately the same proportion as nitrogen. Mars’ atmosphere contains 1.89%
  nitrogen and 1.93% argon.</p>

<p>In my previous book I explained how a Mars base’s atmosphere could use a mixture of nitrogen and
  argon as buffer gas, as this would be energetically cheaper to produce. As both gases have rather
  low boiling points, separating these gases from each other using fractional distillation would
  require a lot of energy, so it’s cheaper to extract these gases together from the atmosphere
  rather than separating them. Since we can safely breathe argon, and because it’s also a buffer
  gas, this would be a more cost-effective approach than extracting pure nitrogen.</p>

<p>However, at Enterprise we will want to produce pure nitrogen and argon for industrial purposes.
  Nitrogen will be required for manufacturing chemicals such as ammonia, and argon may be required
  for welding, lighting, or lasers. Therefore, we will utilise a more advanced air separation system
  that uses cryogenic distillation to produce pure carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon, and perhaps
  other gases, from the Martian atmosphere. This will enable us to use pure nitrogen as the
  settlement's buffer gas, which will be more compatible with the physiology of humans and other
  Terran species in the settlement. Argon could still be utilised as a buffer gas in the event of a
  nitrogen shortage.</p>

<p>The nitrogen partial pressure (ppN2) will be whatever is left over to make up the 53.33 kPa
  total, so we can calculate it:</p>

<div class="math">
  <p><span class="tab">ppN2 </span>= pTotal - ppO2 - ppCO2 - ppH2O</p>
  <p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= (53.33 - 16.00 - 0.03 - 1.37) kPa</p>
  <p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 35.93 kPa</p>
</div>

<p>This completes the atmosphere design.</p>

<p>For an R value of 1, the spacesuit pressure must match the nitrogen gas pressure in the
  settlement, which in this design is about 36 kPa. Fortunately, the mechanical counter-pressure
  spacesuits should be able to match this pressure, which is a very satisfactory result.</p>

<p>There is an important reason why we should make the atmosphere in Serenity the same or very
  similar as in Enterprise. It will then be much easier for people to move from one settlement to
  the other, which many people, especially the actual construction enginauts, may want or need to
  do. The different gravity will still be a challenge, but at least if the atmospheres in each
  settlement have the same total and oxygen pressures, it will be that much easier to adapt.</p>

<h3>Farm and greenhouse atmospheres</h3>

<p>Farm and greenhouse atmospheres could potentially be optimised for plant growth rates. For
  example, while humans will begin to feel sleepy in an atmosphere with 1% CO<sub>2</sub>, plants
  will grow more quickly at higher concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, our farm and
  greenhouse areas will benefit from having their own environment control system, separate from the
  human-populated areas of the settlement.</p>

<p>Of course, people still need to enter these areas and work. Recall that current US standards
  specify a maximum concentration of 5000 ppm for up to 8 hours. Although this will be 10 times the
  concentration in the primary settlement atmosphere, it would be a safe level for people working in
  the greenhouses, even for a few hours, and the extra CO<sub>2</sub> will improve crop production.
</p>

<p>Temperatures in farm and greenhouse areas may also vary from the settlement, designed to suit the
  types of crops inside. For example, we may create tropical greenhouses and temperate
  greenhouses.</p>

<p>In order to limit the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> leakage from the greenhouses into the main
  settlement, hard seals will be needed between human areas and agricultural areas. A double door
  system, similar to an airlock, should be sufficient for this purpose.</p>
