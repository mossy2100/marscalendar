<h2>Dates and datetimes</h2>

<p>The standard notations for Utopian dates and datetimes are similar to the international standard <a
  href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a> for Gregorian equivalents, with a few
  differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Martian mir numbers, dates, datetimes, and times are prefixed with ‘<b>M</b>’, to indicate Mars, and to
    distinguish them from Terran equivalents.
  </li>
  <li>Mir numbers do not need to be zero-padded to a fixed number of digits. The current mir number (216 at the time of
    writing) has 3 digits, but this is written as <b>M216</b>, not M0216. When it reaches 1000, it will be <b>M1000</b>.
    This is for future-proofing. Eventually mir numbers will have 4 digits, 5 digits, and so on. (It’s a flaw in ISO
    8601 that years must be expressed as exactly four digits, because the standard will not work from the year 10 000.
    The creators created a Y10K problem, which will affect many databases and systems.)
  </li>
  <li>The first mir in the epoch is <b>M0</b>.</li>
  <li>Negative mir numbers indicate mirs before the start of the epoch, e.g. <b>M–100</b>. There is no equivalent of
    BC/AD or BCE/CE notation.
  </li>
  <li>As with Terran years, thousands separators are not used in mir numbers, e.g. <b>M12345</b> (not M12,345 or M12.345
    or M12 345).
  </li>
  <li>The date separator character is ‘<b>/</b>’ (forward slash). On Earth we different date separators in different
    countries, including ‘<b>–</b>’ (hyphen, dash, or minus sign), ‘<b>/</b>’ (forward slash), and ‘<b>.</b>’ (period or
    decimal point). The ISO 8601 standard uses the dash (e.g. “2016-12-06”). However, the hyphen and period characters
    have other meanings within the Mars datetime format, as a negative sign and a decimal point respectively, therefore
    we must choose an alternative for clarity. The forward slash is the most obvious choice, as it clearly indicates a
    date when used in this way. A different character could potentially be used, e.g. 216^17^22 or 216*17*22, but this
    might be tedious to write, less likely to be adopted, less obviously a date, and unclear as to meaning. The <b>M</b>
    prefix will prevent confusion with Terran dates better than an unusual separator.
  </li>
  <li>As in ISO 8601, the date parts are arranged from most to least significant, i.e.
    <b>M</b>{mir}<b>/</b>{month}<b>/</b>{sol}, e.g. <b>M216/17/08</b>.
  </li>
  <li>As in ISO 8601, month and sol parts of the date are zero-padded to 2 digits, e.g. <b>M216/17/08</b>.</li>
  <li>Times are usually displayed with microsol resolution by showing the number of millisols to 3 decimal places. Both
    the number of millisols and microsols are zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g. <b>012.345, 888.222, 500.000</b>.
  </li>
  <li>As in ISO 8601, a date and time can be combined into a single datetime string using the ‘<strong>T</strong>' as a
    separator between the date and the time, e.g. <b>M216/17/08T123.456</b>.
  </li>
  <li>When displayed without a date, Martian times can optionally be prefixed with ‘<b>MT</b>’ to distinguish them from
    ordinary numbers if necessary, e.g. <b>MT012.345, MT567.222</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Times can also be shown with only millisol resolution, e.g. <b>MT012</b>, <b>MT777</b>.</li>
  <li>If required, the timezone can be shown as the offset in decisols, in the range –5, –4, ... –1, +0, +1, ... +5,
    e.g. <b>M216/17/08T123.456+3</b>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Long date format</h2>

<p>The long date format looks like:</p>

<p class="indent"><b>M</b>{mir} {monthName} {sol}</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p class="indent"><b>M216 Tucana 24</b></p>

<p>The ‘<b>M</b>’ prefix in front of the mir indicates a Martian date, and eliminates confusion about which number
  refers to the mir and which to the sol.</p>
