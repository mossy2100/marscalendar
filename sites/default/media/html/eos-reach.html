<h2>Description</h2>

<p>EOS/Reach is a sphere with diameter of 20 km. It has open circular entrances at the north and
  south poles, each of which has a diameter of about 443 m, and a hollow cylinder running through
  the centre of the station. Spacecraft arrive and depart through these large circular openings and
  dock inside this cylinder.</p>

<p>The axis of rotation is perpendicular to the ecliptic, which makes it almost parallel with Luna’s
  axis of rotation. The station completes one full rotation every 3 minutes, or 480 times per day.
  This rotation achieves two important effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It prevents one side of the station being exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods of
    time, thus preventing any side from becoming too hot or too cold.
  </li>
  <li>It produces an artificial gravity effect within the station, via centripetal force.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the external spherical hull, EOS/Reach has five concentric cylinders, which are floors
  within the station. Each has a different radius, and thus a different gravity level. The radius of
  each level is calculated such that the gravity level corresponds to a world of the Inner Solar
  System. In order of increasing radius and thus increasing gravity, the floors correspond to Ceres,
  Luna, Mars/Mercury, Venus, and Earth, and are thus designated by Floors C, L, M, V, and E
  respective. Floors E and C will most likely be built first, followed by L, M, and finally, V.</p>

<p>Transit between the floors is achieved with elevators. As someone “descends” from, for example,
  Floor C to E, they will experience a steady increase in gravity from Ceres level (0.27
  m/s<sup>2</sup>) to Earth level (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>The intention is that EOS/Reach be placed between Earth and Luna, at the “one week” orbit. This
  orbit has a synodic period of exactly one week (the sidereal period is 6.8684 days), which means
  it will return to the same place in the sky relative to Earth and the Sun at the same time each
  week. This orbital radius is 152&nbsp;629 km, which is almost exactly 40% of the way to Luna from
  Earth.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>Due to the large mass, most of the materials for construction materials are expected to come from
  Luna. Therefore, a reasonable industrial base on Luna, and the capacity to launch large payloads
  from the lunar surface to Earth orbit, are prerequisites. The expected start date of construction
  will be sometime in the 22<sup>nd</sup> century, after self-sustaining settlements on Luna and
  Mars have already been established.</p>

<p>The space station will be constructed from lunar steel, which will probably be an alloy of iron,
  magnesium, and perhaps other elements yet to be determined. The external hull will be trusses of
  steel beams, connected along edges of a tessellated sphere, which will appear as a polyhedron with
  hundreds of triangular faces. This will produce a very strong and stable structure. The four
  internal cylinders will also be constructed from steel trusses. Eight large spokes will run from
  the equator through the centre of the sphere, tying the sphere and the cylinders together, and
  prevent excessive outward bulge.</p>

<p>The outer hull is partly covered in solar panels, which are also fabricated on Luna, where large
  solar panel factories will be established to support lunar settlements, free space settlements,
  spacecraft, and power satellites. The total area of the external hull is approximately 1257
  km<sup>2</sup>, but it should not be necessary to completely cover this area with solar panels.
  Initially, a belt of solar panels would be built around EOS/Reach’s equator, and then expanded
  towards the poles as energy requirements increase over time.</p>

<p>For the station to maintain its axis of rotation precisely coincident with the axis of the
  central cylinder, which is necessary for the desired artificial gravity effects, its mass must be
  balanced around this axis. To achieve this, large water tanks will be located underneath each
  floor and/or in the outer hull. Water will be pumped around and between floors and the hull to
  maintain mass balance and thus the desired axis of rotation.</p>

<h2>Features of the floors</h2>

<p>Each floor comprises a layer of at least 10 metres of dirt, to support the growing of all kinds
  of plants including trees. Below this will be storage tanks for water, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon
  dioxide, and other necessary volatiles; environment control and life support systems; power
  systems; and recycling systems. There will be underground and aboveground structures on each
  floor, such as accommodation, shops, offices, workshops, and schools, and medical, research, and
  industrial facilities. The ceiling is currently anticipated to be about 200 metres above the datum
  on each floor (excluding Floor C), with light piped in from the external hull. Day-night cycles
  would be simulated on each level by opening and closing of light pipes.</p>

<p>Floor C will be open to space; it will not have a ceiling or atmosphere. This is where spacecraft
  dock, entering and departing through the circular openings at the poles. It may be possible for
  arriving spacecraft to match the speed of rotation and dock with the moving surface; otherwise, we
  may include “docking rings” that rotate at the same speed in the opposite direction relative to
  the space station, to provide a stationary platform for spacecraft to dock. After docking, the
  rotational velocity of a docking ring would gradually change until it matched that of the station,
  so that alighting passengers and crew can easily and safely move into the station. Floor C is a
  tube 20 kilometres long, with about 27 square kilometres of area. In addition to docking bays, it
  will also provide cargo storage, a propellant depot (fuel station), and workshops where spacecraft
  repairs and maintenance can be performed.</p>

<p>Floor L will be primarily utilised for sports and recreation, lunar-related research, and
  international and interplanetary conferences.</p>

<p>On Floor M, there will be a large “Mars tank” dedicated to realistic simulation of the Martian
  environment, including gravity, which is a difficult feature to simulate on Earth. This will
  permit astronaut training and experimentation with robotics and other equipment in a realistic
  Mars environment, without the need for travelling all the way to Mars. Although people will be on
  Mars at this time, it will be convenient for Terran scientists to have a facility like this closer
  to Earth. Only floor M will have this feature. To provide a similar tank on Floor V, simulating
  the Venusian environment, would be difficult due to the extreme conditions on Venus, and it would
  seem unnecessary to provide a Luna tank since Luna is quite close.</p>

<p>Floor V will be dedicated to Venusian science, accommodation, and terraforming research. It will
  host a large and lush biosphere, and a university.</p>

<p>On Floor E, a large, natural-looking river will flow through the centre of the level, with
  additional water features such as streams and waterfalls off to the sides, flowing into the river.
  Floor E is 11 km wide, therefore, there will be more than 5 km of land on each side of the river.
  The river will be suitable for swimming, boating, and other water sports, and will also support a
  number of large aquaculture farms.</p>

<p>Every floor will have some sort of accommodation, suited to people from that world or approximate
  gravity level. Every floor will also have meeting and conference rooms. This highlights one of the
  primary uses of EOS/Reach — it is where people from all over the System can come and meet, and
  attend conferences and so forth. If people from Mars want to meet with people from Earth, for
  instance, it may be too difficult for the Martians to meet on Earth. However, in EOS/Reach, both
  parties could both find comfortable accommodation, and the Terrans could go to the meeting rooms
  on Floor M to meet with the Martians.</p>

<h2>The name</h2>

<p>“Eos” is the name of the Greek goddess of the dawn who was the sister of Selene (Luna) and Helios
  (the Sun). This seemed appropriate. Eos then became EOS, an acronym meaning “Earth Orbit Station”.
  My friend Chris Jannette then suggested the name “Reach”, which is the name of the planet in the
  popular sci-fi computer game “Halo”, and also suggests “reach for the stars”. I liked this name
  very much but I also liked EOS, and thus both were retained. Perhaps one will emerge as more
  popular than the other.</p>

<p>Chris suggested that the tag “EOS” could refer more than one space station in Earth orbit, so for
  example we might have EOS/Reach, EOS/Alpha, EOS/Freedom, EOS/Peace, or whatever.</p>
