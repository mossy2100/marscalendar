<p>Notation for Utopian dates is similar to the international standard ISO 8601 for Gregorian date,
  time, and datetime strings, with a few changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The date, time, or datetime string begins with ‘M’, to indicate that it relates to Mars.</li>
  <li>Mir numbers do not need to be zero-padded to a fixed number of digits. The current mir number
    (216 at the time of writing) has 3 digits, but this is written as <strong>M216</strong>, not
    M0216. When it reaches 1000, it will be M1000. This is for future-proofing. Eventually mir
    numbers will have 4 digits, 5 digits, and so on. It’s actually a flaw in ISO 8601 that years
    must be expressed as exactly four digits, because the standard will not work from the year 10
    000. The creators created a Y10K problem. They should remove this restriction from the standard,
    and prefix the year number with ‘E’ to distinguish an Terran date from a Martian date.
  </li>
  <li>Month and sol parts of the date also don’t need to be zero-padded to 2 digits. e.g. <b>M216/1/5</b>
  </li>
  <li>Negative mir numbers are permitted, e.g. <b>M-100/10/5</b></li>
  <li>Times are displayed as a decimal fraction of a sol, usually to 3 or 5 decimal places, to
    indicate mils or tals respectively, e.g. <b>M.543</b></li>
  <li>The date separator character is ‘/’. On Earth we use hyphen (or minus sign) ‘-’, forward slash
    ‘/’, and period (or decimal point) ‘.’ characters as date separators, depending on the country.
    The ISO 8601 standard uses the hyphen (e.g. “2016-12-06”). However, the hyphen and period
    characters have other meanings within the format, as a negative sign and a decimal point
    respectively, therefore we should choose an alternative for clarity. The forward slash is the
    most obvious choice, as it clearly indicates a date when used in this way. A different character
    could potentially be used, e.g. 216^17^22 or 216*17*22, but this might be tedious to write, less
    likely to be adopted, and unclear as to its meaning (e.g. potentially interpreted as a
    mathematical operator). The ‘M’ prefix will prevent confusion with Terran dates better than an
    unusual separator.
  </li>
  <li>A date and time can be combined into a single datetime string, e.g. <b>M216/17/22.12345</b>
  </li>
  <li>Thousands and thousandths separators are not used and are invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the complete format description looks like:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p><b>M</b>{date}{time}</p>
</div>

<p>Where:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>{date} = {mir}<b>/</b>{month}<b>/</b>{sol}</p>

  <p>{mir} = an integer (negative, 0, or positive), with no thousands separators</p>

  <p>{month} = an integer in the range 1 to 24</p>

  <p>{sol} = an integer in the range 1 to 28</p>

  <p>{time} = <b>.</b>{digits} (i.e. a decimal point followed by at least one digit, and no
    thousandths separators)</p>
</div>

<p>Both {date} and {time} are optional, but obviously not both.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>Date: <b>M216/17/8</b></p>

  <p>Date in negative mir: <b>M-32/17/8</b></p>

  <p>Time, resolution mils: <b>M.543</b></p>

  <p>Time, resolution tals: <b>M.54321</b></p>

  <p>Datetime, resolution mils: <b>M216/17/8.123</b></p>

  <p>Datetime, resolution tals: <b>M216/17/8.12345</b></p>
</div>

<p>Presumably the ISO 8601 standard requires date and time parts to have fixed widths in order to
  simplify parsing, but the above format is easily parsed and more compact.</p>

<p>Times will normally be expressed to 3 decimal places to indicate mils. Comparing Earth times of
  day with Mars:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>00:00 = <b>M.000</b></p>

  <p>06:00 = <b>M.250</b></p>

  <p>12:00 = <b>M.500</b></p>

  <p>18:00 = <b>M.750</b></p>
</div>
