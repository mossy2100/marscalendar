<h2>Tropical and calendar mirs</h2>

<p>The average length of a year in the Gregorian Calendar (the most commonly used calendar on Earth)
  is 365.2425 days. This is very close to the average period between northern hemisphere vernal
  equinoxes, which is 365.242 374 days. This period is known as the <b>tropical year</b>, and it
  covers the full cycle of seasons, from the start of spring to the end of winter. In truth, this is
  just one option for determining the tropical year; any of the seasonal markers can be used (vernal
  equinox, summer solstice, autumnal equinox, or winter solstice), or an average of these. All of
  these values are slightly different due to the gravitational effects of the planets on Earth
  and the Sun.</p>

<p>The northern vernal equinox is when astronomers mark the beginning of the astronomical year. In
  astronomy, we say that that, at this point in the Sun’s path, Ls = 0°. “Ls” means <i>longitude of
    the Sun</i>, which is the position of the Sun against the backdrop of fixed stars that it moves
  across. During the astronomical year, as the Sun appears to move past the stars (from the
  perspective of Earth), Ls gradually increases to 360°.</p>

<p>The average period between northern vernal equinoxes on Mars is 668.5907 sols, and this is used
  as the basis for the calendar mir length in the Darian and Utopian Calendars</p>

<h2>Short and long mirs</h2>

<p>Each calendar mir is a whole number of sols, just like the calendar year is a whole number of
  days in Terran calendars. To ensure the average calendar mir length is 668.5907 sols, a pattern of
  “short” mirs of 668 sols and “long” mirs of 669 sols is defined. This is analogous to the common
  years of 365 days and leap years of 366 days in the Gregorian Calendar. However, the adjectives
  “common” and “leap” aren’t suitable for mirs because short mirs aren’t common, since they occur
  less often than long mirs.</p>

<p>The Utopian Calendar specifies a system of rules similar to those used by the Gregorian Calendar
  to determine when a calendar mir is short or long. These rules produce an average calendar mir
  length of 668.591 sols per mir, which is close enough to 668.5907 for practical purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A mir is short unless one of the following rules applies. (668 sols/mir)</li>
  <li>Odd-numbered mirs are long. (668 + 0.5 = 668.5 sols/mir)</li>
  <li>Mirs divisible by 10 (ending in 0) are also long. (668.5 + 0.1 = 668.6 sols/mir)</li>
  <li><i>Except</i>, mirs divisible by 100 (ending in 00) are short. (668.6 - 0.01 = 668.59
    sols/mir)
  </li>
  <li><i>Except</i>, mirs divisible by 1000 (ending in 000) are long. (668.59 + 0.001 = 668.591
    sols/mir)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is a difference of 668.591 - 668.5907 = 0.0003 sols, or about 27 seconds, per mir. After
  2000 mirs, the error will have accumulated to almost 15 hours. Then the intercalation rules are
  modified to resynchronise the calendar with Mars’ cycle. This is not only necessary to compensate
  for this slight difference between the length of the calendar mir and the northern vernal equinox
  mir, but also because the length of the northern vernal equinox mir is slowly increasing.</p>

<p>The Darian Calendar specifies intercalation rules for the first 10 000 mirs, to achieve this
  resynchronisation:</p>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">6801 to 8400</td>
    <td>(<i>M</i> − 1)\2 + <i>M</i>\10 − <i>M</i>\300</td>
    <td>668.5967</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">8401 to 10000</td>
    <td>(<i>M</i> − 1)\2 + <i>M</i>\10 − <i>M</i>\600</td>
    <td>668.5983</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The result is that the error is only about 1 sol after 12 000 mirs.</p>

<p>The intercalary sol, i.e. the 669<sup>th</sup> sol of the mir in a long mir, is added to the last
  month of the mir. Aside from the logic and benefits of doing this, it reflects the early Roman
  calendar, when March was the first month of the year. January and February were appended to the
  original 10-month calendar around 713 BC, and February was the last month of the year up until
  about 450 BC. As the standard calendar year was only 355 days, it would fall out of sync with the
  seasons, so the Romans would periodically add extra days into February to resynchronise it.
  However, from 450 BC the calendar year started with January, making February the second month.</p>

<p>This is also why September, October, November, and December are now the 9<sup>th</sup>,
  10<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> months, instead of the 7<sup>th</sup>,
  8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 10<sup>th</sup> months, as their Latin prefixes suggest.</p>

<h2>Start of the mir</h2>

<p>As above, the calendar mir begins at (within a sol of) the northern hemisphere vernal equinox,
  when Ls = 0°. This marks the beginning of the spring in the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>There is a poetic bonus gained by choosing to begin the mir with the northern spring. On Earth
  the northern spring begins in March, with the vernal equinox occurring on or close to March 20. As
  mentioned, in the early Roman calendar the year ended began with March. March was named for
  the god Mars, who was originally the Roman god of springtime before he became the god of war.
  Therefore, it’s quite appropriate to begin the new mir at the beginning of spring, which is the
  god Mars’ season.</p>
