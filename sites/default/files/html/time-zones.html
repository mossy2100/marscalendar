<p>Mars is divided into 11 time zones, denoted by <strong>MCT-5</strong> to <strong>MCT+5</strong>.
  “MCT” denotes <strong>Mars Central Time</strong>, the Martian equivalent of UTC (Universal
  Coordinated Time). Some “friendly” names and codes for the time zones are suggested, based on the
  dominant areographical feature in each time zone.</p>

<p>As you may guess, a time zone’s number, from -5 to +5, tells you how many zodes to subtract from,
  or add to, MCT to find the local time. It couldn’t be simpler.</p>

<p>MCT-5 and MCT+5 are 18° wide. All other time zones are 36° wide. MCT-5 and MCT+5 are separated by
  the Mars Date Line (MDL), which coincides with longitude ±180°.</p>

<p>When travelling east, you would add one zode to the local time upon entering a new time zone,
  except for when crossing from MCT+5 to MCT-5 across the MDL, in which case you would subtract 1
  sol from the local date.</p>

<p>Conversely, when travelling <i>west</i>, you would <i>subtract</i> one zode from the local time
  upon entering a new time zone, except for when crossing from MCT-5 into MCT+5 across the MDL, in
  which case you would <i>add</i> 1 sol to the local date.</p>

<p>To find the centre longitude of any time zone other than the edge cases of MCT-5 and MCT+5,
  multiple its number (from -4 to +4) by 36°. To find the western boundary longitude subtract 18°,
  and to find the eastern boundary longitude add 18°.</p>

<p>There is no daylight savings on Mars. Daylight savings was never a very good idea for Earth and
  it causes a lot more problems than it solves.</p>
