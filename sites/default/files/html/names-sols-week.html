<p>This is another difference between the Utopian and Darian Calendars.</p>

<p>The names for the sols of the week in the Darian Calendar parallels the Latin names for the days
  of the week (see the table below). My approach was to learn how the Terran days of the week&nbsp;got
  their names, and take a similar approach for Mars.</p>

<p>In many Terran languages the days of the week are named for the 7 celestial objects that are
  visible with the naked eye and that move across the sky against the backdrop of fixed stars. Thus,
  they are named for the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. (Actually, the
  asteroid Vesta is also occasionally visible to the naked eye, as its surface is highly reflective.
  Vesta is the only asteroid visible to the naked eye, however, only very dimly, and it may not have
  been well-known to ancient astronomers.)</p>

<p>From Mars, there are at least 11 objects that fit this requirement: the Sun, Phobos, Deimos,
  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Luna, Jupiter, Saturn, Ceres, Vesta, and possibly other asteroids. If we
  exclude asteroids, moons of other planets, and Saturn, being the farthest away of the remainder,
  we are left with Sun, Phobos, Deimos, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Jupiter.</p>

<p>From these I created good-sounding names using a “sol” suffix in the same way that English names
  for the days of the week use a “day” suffix. The names are ordered such that they match the names
  of days of the week on Earth, in terms of the celestial objects they are assigned to, with 3
  exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Earth, the second day of the week is named for Luna. To parallel this, the second sol of
    the Martian week is named for Phobos, Mars’ largest and closest moon.&nbsp;In an earlier version
    of the Darian Calendar, this sol was named “Sol Phobotis”.
  </li>
  <li>On Earth, the third day of the week is named for Mars. On Mars, the third sol of the week is
    named for Earth, which seems fair. This sol was originally named “Sol Terrae” in the Darian
    Calendar.
  </li>
  <li>On Earth, the last day of the week is named for Saturn. On Mars, the last sol of the week is
    instead named for Deimos, Mars’ smaller and more distant moon. From the perspective of Mars,
    Deimos is more visible and important than Saturn.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note how the English names for the days of the week use the Norse equivalents for the planetary
  gods. Tiw = Mars, Woden = Mercury, Thor = Jupiter, and Freya = Venus.</p>

<h2>Alternate names</h2>

<p>When I was developing this calendar, I wanted to represent both the Martian moons in the sols of
  the week in the same way that Luna is represented in the days of the week on Earth (Monday, Lunes,
  etc.). However, I did not like having sols called “Phobosol” and “Deimosol”, because these can be
  translated as “fear day” and “terror day”. Yes; the names of the Martian moons mean fear and
  terror. The word “phobia” has the same etymology, from which we derive words like agoraphobia,
  arachnophobia, and so on.</p>

<p>It was for the same reason Tom that changed “Sol Phobotis” to “Sol Lunae” when developing the
  Darian Calendar.</p>

<p>I could follow the example of the Darian Calendar and name two sols for Luna and Saturn, i.e.
  “Lunasol” and “Saturnsol”, which are perfectly good names, but then there would not be any sols
  named for the Martian moons, and these are arguably the second and third most important
  astronomical objects in the Martian sky after the Sun.</p>

<p>With this in mind I decided to take a more challenging and creative approach, and address the
  root problem of (what I perceive as) the bad names for the Martian moons. So, I did some research
  and found new names among the Roman pantheon: “Nerio” and “Liber”. Nerio was Mars’ wife, also
  known as “the strong one”. Liber became the agricultural god when Mars became the god of war (Mars
  used to be the god of agriculture and springtime) and was known as “the free one”. By good
  fortune, neither of these names have been assigned to minor planets. How much better to have
  strength and freedom represented in the Martian skies than fear and terror! This story is
  explained fully in this blog post: <a
    href="https://shaunmoss.blog/2016/12/21/renaming-the-martian-moons/" target="_blank">Renaming
    the Martian Moons</a>. These new names for the moons produce new names for the sols: “Neriosol”
  and “Libersol”. This is my preferred option, and I particularly like how the last sol of the week,
  “Libersol”, can be translated to “free sol”.</p>

<p>If people don’t accept the new names for the Martian moons, then I would prefer the names
  “Lunasol” and “Saturnsol” to “Phobosol” and “Deimosol”. The Martians will decide.</p>

<p>The Kepler Calendar variation used “Terrasol” instead of Earthsol.</p>
