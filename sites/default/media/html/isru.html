<p>ISRU (in situ resource utilisation) is of fundamental importance to the success of any space
  settlement, primarily due to the cost and time associated with space transportation. Shipping
  supplies from Earth to anywhere in space is currently expensive due to Earth's gravity well and
  our current level of technological development with regards to space vehicles. At present there
  are no other locations from where supplies could be shipped.</p>

<p>Luna has an advantage over Mars that reduces the pressure to be as self-sufficient as
  possible, which is that Luna is close to Earth; and, what's more, it's <em>always</em> close,
  which means supplies can be shipped to Luna on relatively short notice at any time. In the case of
  Mars, however, supplies can only be sent every 26 months, when the Earth and Mars are aligned in
  their orbits. In addition, while we remain in a chemical propulsion paradigm the transfer times to
  Mars for cargo are on the order of 4-9 months, which is rather a long time to wait for a critical
  delivery.</p>

<p>Relying on Earth for critical resources such as air, water, food and basic materials will
  make any space settlement vulnerable, in much the same way that a Terran nation that needs to
  import food, oil or steel is vulnerable. Resource shortages, price rises, conflict, or issues with
  transportation systems could interrupt imports. A space settlement relying on Earth for
  critical resources would be vulnerable to shortages on Earth, lack of vehicles, war, natural
  disasters, economic downturn, and so on.</p>

<p>If a settlement is lacking in critical resources, it could fail. For example, if it runs low on
  energy, then the ECLSS could fail; if it runs low on food, people could starve; if it runs low on
  spare parts or the materials to make them, then equipment failure could also mean serious
  problems.</p>

<p>For maximising each settlement's survivability, it is therefore necessary for us to able to
  produce all, or almost all, of the resources we need from the local environment; especially
  critical resources such as energy, air, water and food.</p>

<p>As space transportation becomes cheaper and faster, ISRU will become less important, and space
  colonies will participate in trade (imports and exports) much as Terran nations do today.</p>

<p>There are two basic categories of resources that we need to consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Fundamentals</strong>. These are the most important, and the ability to produce them from
    local resources must be developed as early as possible. They are:
    <ol>
      <li>Energy</li>
      <li>Propellant</li>
      <li>Air</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Food</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Materials</strong>. While some spare parts can come from Earth, basic materials are
    necessary for repair and expansion of the settlement. The emphasis with regards to ISRU, in the
    near term, will be on materials that are relatively easy to produce, and represent a high
    mass fraction of the settlement. For example:
    <ol>
      <li>Steel</li>
      <li>Concrete</li>
      <li>Glass</li>
      <li>Bricks</li>
      <li>Plastic</li>
      <li>Useful plants such as hemp and bamboo</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Producing these resources on Luna and Mars is discussed in the following chapters.</p>
