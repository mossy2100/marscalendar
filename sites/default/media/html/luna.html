<p>It has been said that Luna is the 8<sup>th</sup> continent. It is the closest world to Earth, and
  always only a couple of days travel away (potentially much less in the near future).</p>

<h2>Settlement</h2>

<p>People have speculated about settlement of Luna for decades. This was the major focus of the
  Artemis Society and their associated membership organisation, the Moon Society. From 1987 until
  2012, the Moon Society produced a newsletter known as Moon Miners’ Manifesto, edited and largely
  written by the Moon Society’s long-time president, Peter Kokh, which detailed a wide range of
  ideas relevant to human settlement of Luna. A quick web search will connect you with these
  newsletters in PDF format; if you’re interested in lunar settlement, these are an excellent
  resource.</p>

<p>In some ways Luna will be a challenge to settle. Although its proximity is a major advantage,
  Luna is comparatively sparse in several fundamental life support resources, namely water, carbon,
  and nitrogen. These resources can be obtained from cold traps in the polar regions, but they may
  not be available in sufficient quantities to support large populations across Luna, and harvesting
  them may prove difficult and expensive, requiring robots capable of operating in ultra-low
  temperatures and excavating material harder than rock.</p>

<p>Because Luna is so close to Earth, it’s feasible that colonies on Luna could be supplied with
  these resources from Earth’s abundant reserves; however, reliance on Earth for fundamental life
  support resources such as these would place any colony at serious risk. Should supplies be
  interrupted for some reason — climate change, war, economic downturn, loss of investor confidence,
  insufficient vehicles, etc. — then the colony might fail. This risk can be offset to a large
  degree with highly efficient recycling systems, however, without the ability to increase the
  inventory of these resources, settlements will not be able to grow.</p>

<p>Another challenge is Luna’s diurnal (day-night) cycle of 29.5 days. This means approximately two
  weeks with daylight followed by approximately two weeks without. This will increase the energy
  requirements of settlements due to the need for artificial light and heat during the lunar night,
  and possibly restrict surface activities at certain times.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, due to its proximity and value, settlement of Luna seems inevitable in some form.
  Initially, we will most likely see scientific research bases analogous to those in Antarctica,
  either permanently or seasonably inhabited. Then, because Luna represents a source of valuable
  resources in a shallow gravity well, we will also see mining and manufacturing companies
  establishing facilities there, which would include some combination of permanent and seasonal
  staff.</p>

<p>Hotels may prove to be one of the most popular businesses on Luna. Lunar tourism could become
  more popular than tourism in free space, because there will be more to see and do, or Mars,
  because of its proximity to Earth. Luna is beautiful and exotic, and will be a fun and cool place
  to visit. Short stays are likely to be preferred due to the probable high cost of staying there,
  in addition to the deleterious effects of the low lunar gravity, which is about one-sixth of
  Earth’s. Hotels, too, may have a mix of permanent and seasonal staff.</p>

<p>Some lunar settlers could be wealthy retirees. Having made their money, the idea of living out
  one’s remaining years in an exotic location, where the gravity is kind to old bones, may appeal to
  many elderly people. Having said that, the same people who can afford to retire on Luna will
  almost certainly also be able to afford the anti-ageing medical treatments likely to be available
  during the same time frame as lunar settlement.</p>

<h2>Science</h2>

<p>There are scientific questions about our Solar System and Galaxy that are arguably best answered
  on Luna:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>We can study the space environment.</b> Earth’s magnetosphere makes it difficult to study
    the solar wind, cosmic rays, and meteoroids, as charged particles are deflected by the
    magnetosphere or blocked by the atmosphere, and most meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere before
    reaching the ground. However, Luna’s magnetic field is very weak compared to Earth’s, and it has
    virtually zero atmosphere. Solar and cosmic radiation and meteorites impact the lunar surface
    directly, making it an excellent place to study them. We can collect valuable data on what kind
    of risks astronauts will be exposed to in interplanetary space, and learn more about the Solar
    System and our Galaxy.
  </li>
  <li><b>We can study the history of the Solar System.</b> Not only can we study the present space
    environment on Luna, but also the past. Because the solar wind, cosmic rays, and meteorites have
    been impacting the lunar surface directly for billions of years, the lunar regolith contains a
    detailed record of almost the entire history of our Solar System since it formed. There are
    surfaces on Luna which are 4.5 billion years old, dating almost from the birth of the Solar
    System. We don’t find this on Earth, which is constantly being resurfaced by plate tectonics,
    wind, and water.
  </li>
  <li><b>We can do advanced astronomy.</b> Without an atmosphere, stars can be viewed from the lunar
    surface without any distortion, and there’s minimal light pollution. During the lunar night,
    Luna will be an excellent location for deep space optical astronomy. Arrays of telescopes could
    be constructed on the far side of Luna for VLBI (very long baseline interferometry), similar to
    the SKA (Square Kilometre Array), although potentially much larger, in which electromagnetic
    radiation, such as optical, infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, or radio, from multiple telescopes
    are combined to produce images with extremely high resolution. An optical telescope or telescope
    array on Luna may be capable of imaging terrestrial exoplanets, some of which could host life,
    inspiring yet more ambitious space settlement plans. Locating telescopes on Luna, rather than in
    free space, has the benefit that Luna provides all the materials with which to make them.
    Engineers based on Luna will be able to access, service, and upgrade lunar telescopes more
    easily than if they were in space. The far side of Luna is actually one of the best places in
    the Solar System for radio astronomy, because the world itself blocks radio noise from Earth.
    The two biggest sources of radio noise in the Solar System are the Sun and Jupiter; these would
    both be out of sight of a far-side lunar observatory 25% of the time, giving near-perfect
    conditions. We can conduct very low frequency radio astronomy (&lt; 20 MHz) on Luna, which
    cannot be done on Earth because the ionosphere is opaque to these frequencies. It may also be
    possible to build telescopes with large liquid reflectors on Luna. These are spun to cause the
    reflective liquid to adopt a parabolic shape; however, on Earth, the spinning produces wind that
    causes distortion. This won’t occur on Luna because there’s virtually no atmosphere. Astronomers
    tend to be divided on the topic of lunar-based telescopes, with many favouring space-based
    telescopes. This is mainly because we have more experience with space-based telescopes (Hubble,
    for instance), there’s no risk of moonquakes interfering with observations, and continuous solar
    power is available. However, this is not an argument against lunar settlement or industry, since
    space telescopes could be built on Luna and launched from there more cheaply than from Earth due
    to the shallower gravity well. Placing telescopes on Luna is the goal of the International Lunar
    Observatory Association (<a href="http://iloa.org">http://iloa.org</a>).
  </li>
  <li><b>We can look at Earth.</b> The near side of Luna is an excellent location for Earth
    observation. Because Luna is tidally locked to Earth, from the near side of Luna our home planet
    remains constantly in the same position in the sky, performing a complete revolution about once
    every 24.8 hours. Telescopes on the lunar near side could image Earth in detail, collecting a
    wide range of data about our climate, biosphere, geology, civilisation, and more. It’s debatable
    whether lunar telescopes would be superior to observation satellites in Earth orbit for this
    purpose, as they will be much farther away, but they do offer the advantage that a full
    hemisphere of Earth can be imaged all at once, and telescope arrays could be used to provide
    ultra-high resolution. Also, being outside the magnetosphere and Van Allen Belts, Luna may be an
    ideal place to study them. Observing Earth from Luna will expose more people to the Overview
    Effect and will therefore advance world peace and the unification of humanity.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although some lunar science can be conducted telescopically and telerobotically, we will learn
  much more by having people on the surface, who are smarter and more adaptive, intuitive, agile,
  and capable than robots.</p>

<p>There is still much to learn, discover and achieve on Luna. The subsurface lunar environment and
  geology, which is very different from the surface, can be studied by drilling, and subsurface
  structures can be investigated using radar. We can explore lava tubes on Luna; if uncollapsed lava
  tubes can be discovered, they could make ideal locations to situate habitats, providing thermal
  insulation and protection from radiation. We need to visit the poles where settlements are likely
  to be built. We will develop ISRU processes for Luna, explore the far side, and much more.</p>

<h2>Tourism and sport</h2>

<p>Studies have shown that the first major industry to develop in space will probably be tourism.
  One 2002 study showed that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market by 2030. Seven space
  tourists have already flown to space with the company Space Adventures, who are now selling
  tickets on circumlunar flights. Virgin Galactic has already sold almost 800 tickets for suborbital
  flights. Bigelow Aerospace, founded by the successful Las Vegas hotel magnate Robert Bigelow, has
  developed concepts for orbital space hotels. Moon Express have advertised that flights to the
  lunar surface may be available by 2026 for just $10&nbsp;000. Within a decade or two we can expect
  lunar landings, moonwalk experiences, lunar hotels, and lunar adventure travel and sports.</p>

<p>Luna is likely to be a more popular destination for the space tourist than Mars, or possibly
  anywhere else in the Solar System, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Proximity.</b> It only took the Apollo crews three days to reach Luna, and new propulsion
    systems will make the trip even quicker. This is a reasonable travel time for a tourist
    destination, particularly one in space. A flight to Mars, however, may take 3-6 months, which
    would be an impractical proposition for most tourists. Flights to Mars will undoubtedly get
    shorter, but then, so will flights to Luna. For this reason Luna may always be preferred by
    tourists, depending on the activities, facilities, and culture that develop on each world.
  </li>
  <li><b>The view.</b> The lunar near side offers one of the Solar System’s best view of Earth.
    Think of how big Luna appears in our sky, then multiply it by 3.7, and that’s how big Earth
    appears from Luna. Earth is a beautiful planet, and always appears more-or-less in the same
    position in the lunar sky because Luna is tidally locked to Earth. A lunar tourist will be able
    to watch their blue-green-white home planet rotating slowly in the starry lunar sky from the
    window of a hotel room or restaurant. Luna also offers a superb view of the Galaxy, offering an
    authentic and breathtaking view of the stars, unaffected by atmospheric distortion or light
    pollution from cities. These advantages also exist for Earth orbit, but you need to be a medium
    or high Earth orbit to see the whole Earth at once.
  </li>
  <li><b>Fun.</b> The low gravity and varied lunar terrain suggests all manner of low-g sports and
    adventure activities. Imagine driving a dune buggy across the lunar regolith and doing huge
    jumps in the low gravity, or even “regoboarding”, which will be something like snowboarding or
    sandboarding, except on grey slopes of lunar dust. Need I mention low-g sex? Adjusting positions
    and fluid management can be problematic in microgravity, but lunar gravity will be enough to
    mitigate these issues while still offering the advantages of a partner with a fraction of their
    usual weight. Luna is an obvious destination for honeymooners (pun intended).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Luna may develop into the ultimate space tourist destination for Terrans, providing beautiful
  views of Earth, and a fun, low-g environment great for all kinds of sports and recreation. For a
  while at least, Mars is too far away to be a holiday hot-spot. Mars may be more popular for
  emigration, but Luna will be preferred for a vacation.</p>

<h2>Energy</h2>

<p>Being close to the Sun, and lacking a gaseous atmosphere, Luna is the second-best world in the
  Solar System after Mercury for utilisation of solar energy. Without clouds or airborne
  particulates the lunar surface receives greater solar irradiance than Earth.</p>

<p>The month-long lunar day will mean two weeks of darkness at a stretch for most lunar settlement,
  which means significant energy storage capacity will be required to keep a settlement ticking over
  for that length of time. However, there is a solution. Because Luna’s axis is nearly perpendicular
  to the ecliptic, there are mountains and ridges near the poles that receive almost continuous
  sunlight. These are known as “peaks of eternal light” (PELs). Technically, this is a misnomer,
  since these sunniest of these locations only receive sunlight around 80-85% of the time. However,
  this is still much better than 50%, and is one of the main reasons why such locations are favoured
  for settlements.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Luna has plentiful resources for life support and industry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Luna is abundant in <b>oxygen</b>, which constitutes about 45% by weight of lunar dirt. It can
    be extracted by pyrolysis (intense heating), or by more moderate heating in the presence of
    hydrogen, which produces water that can be electrolysed. Not only is oxygen a valuable life
    support resource, it’s also the most common oxidiser in, and the heaviest component of, rocket
    propellant.
  </li>
  <li>The next most common element on Luna after oxygen is <b>silicon</b>, the primary element in
    glass, microchips, and silicone. Lunar silicon could be used to make solar panels.
  </li>
  <li>Luna has <b>water</b>, on the order of hundreds of millions to a billion tons
    (1&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>), primarily found in permanently-shadowed regions (PSRs) at the poles.
    Over most of the lunar surface the concentration of water is very low, perhaps 0.1% of the
    regolith. This water is formed by protons (hydrogen nuclei) from the solar wind impacting the
    lunar regolith and bonding with oxygen atoms. The permanently dark craters at the poles,
    however, may contain up to 8.5% water in the form of ice crystals mixed in the regolith. This
    water comes from crashed comets, and due to the permanent darkness and extremely low
    temperatures in these craters, it has never vaporised and escaped to space. Not only could this
    water be utilised for life support, but it could also be electrolysed into hydrogen and oxygen
    for rocket propellant. Water within a lunar settlement will be recycled with high efficiency.
    Lunar water may be very challenging to mine, however, and it might be easier to import water
    from Earth during the early stages of a colony.
  </li>
  <li><b>Iron</b> is the most common metal on Luna, which is unsurprising since, being the endpoint
    of stellar fusion, iron is common everywhere in the Universe. Easily obtained from lunar
    regolith, settlers will be able to make many things from this useful metal. Because carbon is
    sparse, making <b>steel</b> might not be easy, but Lunans may be able to substitute with iron or
    iron alloys incorporating other metals available on Luna, such as magnesium, aluminium, and
    titanium. However, not a lot of carbon is needed for steel, and there are several possible
    sources. There’s a tiny bit in the regolith, it can be found in greater quantities in the PSRs,
    and it could also be obtained from nearby carbonaceous asteroids.
  </li>
  <li>Three of the most important <b>light engineering metals</b> — magnesium, aluminium, and
    titanium — are available in abundance on Luna. They may not be a viable export product, since
    Terran customers can obtain these metals more cheaply from Earth. However, they will be valuable
    to lunar industry, and perhaps the asteroid mining industry, too. Metals like these are most
    commonly employed where weight and performance are paramount, such as in the automotive and
    aerospace industries. Because it’s comparatively easier to launch stuff from Luna than Earth due
    to the significantly lower gravity, a commercial opportunity may exist to manufacture hardware
    like rockets, spacecraft, rovers, robots, other kinds of machinery, and space station or space
    settlement modules from local materials on Luna. Spaceships and machinery bound for Mars and
    elsewhere in the System could be built on Luna.
  </li>
  <li>Luna is also rich in <b>rare earth elements</b>, and these indeed may be a viable export
    product, as the demand for these valuable metals is increasing as supplies are dwindling on
    Earth. Rare earth elements are found in a wide range of technological components, including
    lasers, lamps, sensors, magnets, batteries, and more. Exporting rare earth elements from Luna to
    Earth may ultimately prove to be the most viable and profitable lunar industry.
  </li>
  <li>The valuable <b>platinum group metals</b> are also more common on the lunar surface than on
    Earth’s. Being heavier metals, on Earth they sank towards the planet’s core during its
    formation. However, they’re comparatively abundant in asteroids, which is one reason why
    asteroid mining is so compelling and potentially profitable; and, since quite a lot of asteroids
    have crashed into the lunar surface over the past 4.5 billion years, these metals can be found
    in the lunar regolith. Harvesting these metals on Luna may prove cheaper than obtaining them
    from asteroids, at least for local customers.
  </li>
  <li><b>Helium-3</b> is perhaps the most famous of lunar resources due to its exotic nature and
    high projected value. Helium nuclei from the solar wind impact the lunar regolith directly,
    causing helium atoms to become embedded in the dirt. Most of this helium is garden-variety
    helium-4, but about one in every 10&nbsp;000 atoms is the less common but stable helium-3, which
    is one of the best known fuels for nuclear fusion. Unfortunately, helium-3 isn’t very common on
    Earth because Earth’s magnetic field deflects the solar wind around the planet. Almost all the
    helium on Earth has been produced by the decay of radioactive elements like plutonium, uranium,
    and thorium, which produces helium-4, not helium-3. If fusion ever becomes a mainstream energy
    source, lunar helium-3 could be worth a fortune to energy-hungry Earth; however, it remains to
    be seen if this will happen. Fusion is tricky. All fusion reactions under consideration either
    produce too many neutrons, only occur at insanely high temperatures, or require fuel which is on
    Luna. There are easier ways to generate abundant, clean electricity. Another factor is that
    mining lunar helium-3 may be unpopular with settlers, since obtaining it would be destructive to
    the unique and beautiful lunar landscape. The concentration of helium-3 in the lunar regolith is
    tiny — between about 1.4 and 50 ppb (parts per billion) — which means obtaining it in economical
    quantities could require strip-mining large areas of the surface. Then again, Luna is pretty
    big, and we may want to clear large areas of regolith anyway, for things like spaceports and
    industrial areas. Helium-3 may yet become an important economic driver for lunar development.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Overview Effect</h2>

<p>Astronauts report that seeing the whole Earth at once from space produces a profound realisation
  that national borders are imaginary; that we are not divided; that humanity is, in fact, a global
  family; and that our planet is a beautiful, fragile, and precious living being, and our shared
  home and responsibility. This is known as the “Overview Effect”, and will be experienced by
  near-side lunar settlers on a constant basis. Luna is tidally-locked to Earth, which means, in
  contrast to how Luna moves across the Terran sky, from the near side of Luna, Earth remains
  more-or-less in a constant position in the lunar sky, rotating in place. (Settlers on the far side
  wouldn’t see Earth at all.)</p>

<p>As a growing number of people perceive Earth in this way and experience the Overview Effect, and
  take these realisations back to Earth, this will encourage a shift towards global unity, world
  peace, and increased environmental awareness and social responsibility. Having a presence on Luna
  may become of great importance in uniting and inspiring the people of Earth.</p>

<h2>Challenges of lunar settlement</h2>

<p>There are some significant challenges associated with lunar settlement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Luna is sparse in hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen; three of the four most important elements
    for life as we know it (the other being oxygen, which Luna has plenty of). Being major
    constituents of food, wood, plastic, people, and many other important things, these elements are
    very important. They will be considered precious by Lunans, and recycled with a high efficiency.
    For the lunar population to grow, it will need a supply of these elements. Most of Luna’s
    hydrogen can be found in the PSRs, and it’s believed that this is where we’ll also find most of
    its carbon and nitrogen. Alternately, we may import these elements in some form, from Earth or
    the asteroids. In the early years, water, nitrogen, and coal could be shipped up from Earth;
    eventually, volatiles such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>),
    or ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), could be mined from nearby asteroids and sold to lunar settlements.
  </li>
  <li>Luna is covered in a ubiquitous dust, which is jagged, abrasive, and sticky. (Martian dust, by
    contrast, is smoother due to perpetual wind erosion.) Both lunar and Martian dust are
    problematic for moving parts and health; however, lunar dust is worse due to its abrasiveness
    and adhesiveness. Luna at least has the advantage of no wind to blow dust around; although, the
    engines of arriving and departing rockets will kick up a lot of dust, which will travel far in
    the low gravity. (On the plus side, lunar dust is a valuable resource: pre-powdered ore.)
  </li>
  <li>Because of Luna’s 29.5-day diurnal cycle, an artificial 24-hour day-night cycle will need to
    be created within habitats and farms, increasing energy requirements. During the roughly two
    weeks when the Sun is shining this won’t be problem; simply draw the shades during the simulated
    night. During the two weeks of darkness, however, we will need to use artificial interior
    lighting during the simulated Terran day. The long lunar monthly cycle may present a challenge
    for humans and other Terran life adapted to a 24-hour cycle. Genetic engineering will be useful
    for adapting crops to these conditions.
  </li>
  <li>During the lunar month the temperature ranges from extremely cold (-200 °C) to extremely hot
    (120 °C), which will greatly increase the energy required for environment control within
    habitats. It also presents a problem for machinery, since the constant expansion and contraction
    of metal parts could cause fatigue and failure. We can mitigate this problem by locating the
    settlement at a lunar pole, where the thermal environment is much more benign because the Sun
    does not shine directly down on the surface, but sits near the horizon all the time, just like
    at Earth’s poles. Lunar settlements will need to be mostly buried or underground, which will
    provide thermal insulation as well as protection from radiation.
  </li>
  <li>The lunar gravity is quite low, about one-sixth of Earth’s, and less than half of Mars’. From
    our observations of astronauts in LEO, it seems that exposure to such low gravity will cause
    significant loss of bone and muscle mass unless countermeasures are taken. Hopefully medical
    technology will exist by then to prevent this effect, but, if not, it may be very difficult for
    Lunans to visit Earth, and most people will go to Luna just temporarily, to visit or work.
  </li>
  <li>Luna cannot be terraformed, although paraterraforming* will be possible. If Earth is hit by
    another big asteroid, a human presence on Luna may not ensure the ongoing survival of humans or
    other Terran species, depending on what and how many resources and people are on Luna at the
    time.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, early lunar settlements will probably be seasonally inhabited like Antarctic
  bases. One of Luna’s great advantages compared with Mars is that short stays are easier. However,
  as technology with which to overcome these challenges improves, and the multitudinous virtues of
  Luna become manifest, more people will choose to make it their home.</p>

<p>
  <small>* “Parraterraforming” means creating an Earth-like environment in an enclosed volume. On
    Luna such a volume could take the form of domes, lava tubes, or artificial underground caverns,
    which would be pressurised with Terran air at a comfortable temperature, and contain ecosystems
    featuring a range of plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms.
  </small>
</p>

<h2>Plans for Luna</h2>

<h3>Space agencies</h3>

<p><b>NASA</b> considers the Earth-Luna system and NEAs (near Earth asteroids) as a “proving ground”
  where deep space technologies and protocols for human missions can be tested in advance of
  missions to Mars. They are currently planning to send a number of spacecraft to Luna in 2018,
  followed by a crewed mission to lunar orbit in the Orion capsule in 2023. Serious plans were
  produced in 2006 to establish an outpost on Luna in the early 2020’s, however, these were
  unfortunately suspended.</p>

<p><b>ESA</b> has announced plans for a “Moon Village”, where space agencies and companies will
  engage in research and commercial activities. This project is gaining considerable attention. They
  are planning their first human landing around 2024.</p>

<p><b>JAXA</b> has plans to send a rover to Luna by 2019, followed by a human landing in 2025. They
  had previously announced the development of a robotic base at the lunar south pole by 2020, which
  would be crewed by 2030; however, it seems that schedule has since been pushed back.</p>

<p><b>CNSA</b> is planning a number of lunar landers, including sample return missions, between 2017
  and 2020, followed by a human landing sometime between 2025 and 2030.</p>

<p><b>Roscosmos</b> is planning a robotic lander mission for 2025 as part of their Luna-Glob
  program, followed by a crewed orbiter in 2028, and a human landing in 2030. Their next goal is to
  develop a robotic lunar base by 2037.</p>

<p><b>ISRO</b> is planning to send Chandrayaan-2 to Luna in 2018. This is a follow-up to the
  successful Chandrayaan-1 mission, and comprises a lunar orbiter, lander, and rover.</p>

<p>Although NASA’s moonbase plans were cancelled, they listed six main reasons in support of a
  return to Luna, which are still valid:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Human Civilisation:</b> Extend human presence to Luna to enable eventual settlement.</li>
  <li><b>Scientific Knowledge:</b> Pursue scientific activities that address fundamental questions
    about the history of Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe; and therefore, about our place
    in them.
  </li>
  <li><b>Exploration Preparation:</b> Test technologies, systems, flight operations, and exploration
    techniques to reduce the risks and increase the productivity of future missions to Mars and
    beyond.
  </li>
  <li><b>Global Partnerships:</b> Provide a challenging, shared, and peaceful activity that unites
    nations in pursuit of common objectives.
  </li>
  <li><b>Economic Expansion:</b> Expand Earth’s economic sphere, and conduct lunar activities with
    benefits to life on the home planet.
  </li>
  <li><b>Public Engagement:</b> Use a lively space exploration program to engage the public,
    encourage students, and help develop the high-technology workforce that will be required to
    address the challenges of tomorrow.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>NASA’s plan to establish a lunar outpost had many critics. However, since several other space
  agencies are working towards lunar bases, it seems likely that NASA will become involved somehow.
  Many opportunities for participation will present themselves, and there will be significant
  pressure from lunar scientists within the agency.</p>

<h3>The Asteroid Redirect Mission and the Moon Village</h3>

<p>Competing with resources for human missions to Luna or Mars is NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission
  (ARM), in which a robotic spacecraft will visit an NEA, collect a boulder, and bring it to high
  lunar orbit where it can be visited and studied by astronauts. This is an interesting idea that
  would produce innovation and new scientific knowledge, while also providing NASA with valuable
  experience in human spaceflight. However, it’s a hotly-debated topic in the space community as to
  whether the ARM is the best use of agency resources. If our goal is really to become a
  multiplanetary, spacefaring species then missions to Luna and Mars are much more relevant. Lunar
  missions would be cheaper, plus, because costs could be shared with international partners, and
  the ROI would make it worthwhile. The ARM was selected as something that could be done within the
  agency’s current budget, and that would be relevant to human spaceflight. However, budget is not
  the only reason why ARM was created; NASA is opposed to returning astronauts to Luna as they’re
  reluctant to invest a significant fraction of their budget in simply repeating past
  achievements.</p>

<p>Considering the general negative sentiment that appears to be prevalent in the space community
  about ARM, it may not survive. If cancelled, what will replace it? If NASA genuinely wish to avoid
  human missions to Luna, then a Mars flyby mission would seem to be the best choice, as this is
  quite achievable and affordable, and would result in another great “first” in space (i.e. first
  humans to the Martian system). However, if it has to be one or the other, then joining with
  international partners in the development of a lunar base would arguably be preferable in the near
  term, because of all the benefits discussed.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the major space agencies should all work together on the Moon Village (or an
  International Lunar Research Station), as this would produce the maximum ROI for everyone. Once
  the core base has been established and the relevant precursor missions to Luna completed,
  precursor missions to the Martian system, such as robotic missions to test ISRU and habitat
  systems and human missions such as a flyby, can be commenced, also in an international
  framework.</p>

<h3>Private enterprise</h3>

<p>Eventually, the established lunar base can be sold to private enterprise, who can add
  infrastructure to support tourism, mining, manufacturing, and other lunar industries, and expand
  the base into a settlement. This strategy will free up the international space agencies to focus
  on Mars, while private enterprise continues with lunar development. It would prevent lunar
  research from consuming so much money that human missions to Mars would be excessively delayed,
  which is a major concern for many Mars enthusiasts. Space agencies should blaze the trail, from
  Earth orbit, to Luna, to Mars, passing the baton to private enterprise once they’ve achieved their
  goals in each arena. Of course, it’s also possible, perhaps even probable, that the space industry
  overtakes the agencies, and begins creating bases and settlements throughout the Solar System
  without the need for the agencies’ trailblazing.</p>

<p>Several space companies (Golden Spike, Moon Express, Astrobotic, Shackleton Energy, Bigelow
  Aerospace, and others) are already looking to Luna. Right now, it’s easier to develop a viable
  business case for Luna compared with Mars, because of the considerably lower cost of getting
  there. Unlike the enthusiast community, most entrepreneurs do not have the luxury of pushing
  directly for the sexy red planet, but are constrained by what’s possible in the near term with
  available resources.</p>

<p>Because Mars has more potential for settlement, the Martian economy will ultimately grow much
  larger, but when considering near term commercial opportunities, Luna offers more. Establishing
  industry on Luna will help with the Mars program, because it will stimulate innovation in space
  technology and drive down the cost of hardware. The more activity there is in space generally, the
  more customers there will be, and the larger the space economy.</p>

<p>Human exploration of Luna by space agencies aids private enterprise by providing valuable data
  and technology development. These resources will help companies establish themselves on Luna,
  generating profits and incentives for further space technology development, enabling expansion to
  new arenas such as the asteroids, Mars, and beyond.</p>
