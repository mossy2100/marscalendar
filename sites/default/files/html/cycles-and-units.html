<p>Before getting into how the calendar works, it is useful to review the Martian astronomical
  cycles on which it is based, and the terms and units used in the explanation of the calendar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Martian day is called a <b>sol</b>, which is an abbreviation of “solar day”. A sol has an
    average duration of <b>88&nbsp;775.244&nbsp;09 seconds</b>, which is 1.027&nbsp;49 days, or 24
    hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244&nbsp;09 seconds. Thus, a sol is only about 40 minutes, or 2.75%,
    longer than a Terran day. The word “sol” was introduced by NASA during the Viking missions, and
    has been used to refer to a Martian solar day ever since. The fact that a sol is almost the same
    length as a day is tremendously convenient when designing a calendar, because it permits the
    creation of one very similar to those we’re already familiar with, which use the day &mdash; the
    dominant cycle of human behaviour and society &mdash; as their fundamental unit.
  </li>
  <li>Corresponding terms were developed by the Curiosity mission team, including <b>tosol</b>
    (today), <b>yestersol</b> (yesterday), and <b>nextersol</b> (tomorrow).
  </li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Prefixes"
    target="_blank">SI prefixes</a>, the terms <b>decisol</b> (0.1 sols), <b>millisol</b>
    (10<sup>&#8209;3</sup> sols), and <b>microsol</b> (10<sup>&#8209;6</sup> sols) are derived.
    Thus, there are 10 decisols in a sol, 100 millisols in a decisol, and 1000 microsols in a
    millisol.
  </li>
  <li>A sol is also divided into 100&nbsp;000 <b>tals</b>, which is the equivalent of a Martian
    second. Thus, there are 100 tals in a millisol, and 10 microsols in a tal. In the absence of an
    SI prefix for 10<sup>&#8209;5</sup>, this unit and its name are taken from <i>The Gods of
      Mars</i> by Edgar Rice Burroughs.
  </li>
  <li>The term <b>mir</b> is used for “Martian year”. “Mir” is a Russian word that means “world”,
    “peace”, and “community”, and was the name of the legendary <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir" target="_blank">Russian space station</a>. It means
    “community” in the sense of a community combining their efforts for a common task, such as
    building a church or clearing a field. The word “mir” not only sounds like a perfect contraction
    of “Martian year”, but also invokes the spirit of a group working together with the common cause
    of developing Mars into a peaceful world community. A mir has about <b>668.5907 sols</b>, on
    average, which is equal to about 687 days or 1.88 years.
  </li>
  <li>Using SI prefixes, the terms <b>decamir</b> (10 mirs), <b>hectomir</b> (100 mirs), and <b>
    kilomir</b> (1000 mirs) are derived, for Martian decade, century, and millennium respectively.
  </li>
  <li>The units <b>week</b> and <b>month</b> as used in the calendar do not refer to precise periods
    of time, but rather to periods similar in duration and purpose to weeks and months on Earth.
  </li>
</ul>
