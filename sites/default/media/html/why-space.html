<p>The benefits of space research are not universally appreciated or understood. Some feel that it
  diverts resources away from other important problems, or that it doesn’t produce a sufficient
  return on investment. However, a closer look will reveal that everyone benefits from space
  research and development, not only those nations who conduct missions, and we benefit
  significantly.</p>

<p>The most common argument against space research is that there are more serious problems on Earth
  that we should focus our attention on, such as disease, poverty, economic inequality, climate
  change, war, and/or other social and environmental problems, before trying to expand into space.
  While this may seem a positive and valid standpoint on the face of it, the facts are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there have <i>always</i> been, and probably always will be, problems on Earth;</li>
  <li>these problems are being addressed, and conditions on Earth worldwide are getting better year
    by year;
  </li>
  <li>expansion into space will greatly assist in addressing issues on Earth.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we wait until Earth is “fixed” before going to space, we will never go! There were problems in
  Spain when Chris Colombus set sail for the New World, and in England when James Cook departed for
  the Pacific, yet these voyages of discovery produced increased prosperity and scientific
  understanding, countless innovations, and the discovery of vast and beautiful new lands. Yes, they
  also caused genocide and generations of suffering for indigenous peoples, but we probably won’t
  have this problem on Mars.</p>

<p>The reality is that things have never been better on Earth. We’ve never had less slavery,
  disease, poverty, war, hunger, or homelessness. We’ve never lived longer, had so many tools, or
  been able to connect and communicate with so many others. On average, life is getting better for
  everyone, worldwide, all the time. While many people believe the opposite, in my opinion this is
  at least partially because people develop the impression from movies and television that the past
  was more comfortable and safe than it actually was.</p>

<p>The world improves primarily due to technological innovation. Observing trends in technological
  innovation and social entrepreneurship, we can discern that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Humanity’s problems are being, and will continue to be solved, <i>whether or not we invest
    time and money into space research</i>. Lots of people are working on all kinds of important
    problems, and this won’t suddenly stop when we start building bases on Luna or Mars.
  </li>
  <li>Space research produces significant technological innovation, while also developing minds,
    benefitting national economies, giving us insight into the cosmos and ourselves, and improving
    international relations, all of which add up to <i>making life on Earth a whole lot better</i>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We are not investing too much of our resources into space. The cost of space exploration is
  actually small compared with other categories of government spending. NASA, for example, which is
  by far the best funded of all space agencies, receives $18 billion per year. This may seem a lot,
  but it’s actually less than 0.5% of the US federal budget. Compare this with $600 billion spent on
  the military; over 30 times as much. Or, consider the $90 billion spent on corporate subsidies
  annually. Money isn’t being wasted on space. In fact, space, along with energy, health, education,
  and other areas of scientific research, is grossly underfunded by most nations.</p>

<p>When we think the myriad benefits of space research versus the cost, the return on investment is
  immense compared with other categories of government spending.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why space attracts special criticism is because it garners a lot of media
  attention. This tends to make it a target. Space launches, missions, and discoveries are
  spectacular and watched by millions. In comparison, significantly larger areas of government
  expenditure are kept hidden, or are dull in comparison, and attract much less attention. Because
  many people have been led to believe that the images and stories on television somehow accurately
  reflect reality, this often leads to a skewed perception.</p>

<p>Interest in exploration, development, and settlement of space is growing quickly, especially
  among students. Humans are explorers by nature, and there will always be those of us who desire to
  see what’s beyond the horizon; those whose souls soar at the idea of a huge amount of open,
  unoccupied land, where they can create something new. There is a magical “frontier” feeling, which
  some of us simply crave — <i>a sense of immense creative freedom and self-determination</i>.
  There’s a profound sense of adventure and purpose embedded in the building of something new and
  timeless like a frontier town, and this is intoxicating to a certain type of people. Why struggle
  to fit into a dysfunctional or overcrowded society when you can go somewhere new and create a
  better one?</p>

<p>Some humans simply have the idea of exploration and expansion written in their DNA. These are the
  ones who will go to Luna, Mars, and beyond, and lift our species to a higher plane of existence
  than ever before. From the perspective of space, Earth is a single, whole living planet, and the
  concept of nations appears absurd and obsolete (which it is). It will affect how we perceive
  ourselves as a species.</p>

<p>Space is for dreamers and visionaries. We need such people in our society, because they play an
  important role in our evolution. Our imagination pulls us upwards and onwards, towards the stars.
  Technology is advancing extremely rapidly, and the number of people working on space research in
  both the public and private sectors is growing. It’s just a matter of time before we reach Luna,
  Mars, and worlds beyond.</p>

<p>The primary benefits of space research are covered below.</p>

<h2>Scientific discovery</h2>

<p>Unique scientific insights are gained by studying the space environment and other worlds. Space
  research leads to increased understanding in literally every branch of science, including life
  sciences such as biology and medicine; physical sciences such as physics, astronomy, chemistry,
  and planetary science; social sciences such as psychology and political science; and formal
  sciences such as mathematics and computer science.</p>

<p>Everyone on Earth benefits from the advancement of science. The better we understand our
  Universe, the better we can manage the resources available to us, the more empowered we are to
  invent new things which make our lives better, and the better the decisions we can make about how
  to manage and develop our global civilisation. Technology is built on scientific understanding.
  Scientific discovery enables improvements in the production of food, water, energy, materials,
  homes, medicines, and every kind of technological product from cars to phones to power plants.</p>

<p>Scientific knowledge is increased by inquiry, investigation, and exploration, whether by looking
  into atoms, cells, mineral grains, oceanic depths, or the far reaches of space. We’ve learned much
  about Earth by examining stars, galaxies, other planets, and moons, and we continue to learn more
  every day. The wealth of data collected by planetary spacecraft such as Mars rovers, for example,
  teach us more about planets in general; not only Mars.</p>

<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of the Universe gives us the knowledge necessary to secure the
  survival of humanity and many other Terran species, while creating many opportunities for human
  advancement and evolution. Space research presents specific challenges that lead to unique
  achievements and breakthroughs, and expansion into space will provide numerous other benefits
  beyond simply knowledge.</p>

<h2>Technological innovation</h2>

<p>Space research has produced innovation in materials, communications, computing, transportation,
  consumer products, and countless other areas. Directly or indirectly, these advancements improve
  everyone’s quality of life.</p>

<p>These new technologies do not only benefit people living and working in space or the space
  industry. Technology developed for space often finds applications on Earth. Classic examples
  include the handheld video camera and aerogel, but there are countless others.</p>

<p>Future examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suborbital vehicles developed for space tourism will displace airplanes, to some degree, by
    providing services such as rapid transport, package delivery, and resource distribution.
  </li>
  <li>Communications technologies developed for space will provide everyone on Earth with internet
    access.
  </li>
  <li>Water recycling and food production technologies developed for space can be applied on Earth
    to improve the efficiency of water and food production and consumption.
  </li>
  <li>Renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and geothermal, developed for the
    challenging space environment, can be deployed in remote regions of Earth. Space-based solar
    power will provide power to Terran cities.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Inspiration and education</h2>

<p>Space exploration, especially human space flight, is the grand adventure of our time, and
  inspires many people, particularly young people still choosing their career paths, to become
  astronauts, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. People associate space with the future,
  advanced technology, robots, spaceships, and distant, exotic worlds, all of which activate the
  imagination because they are so fantastic. It’s the reason why science fiction exists as a
  distinct genre and why many bright young people aspire to work in the space program. Science
  fiction inspires, and is inspired by, human activities in space.</p>

<p>Increased enrolment in STEAM courses provides huge benefits to national economies, as many of the
  newly educated find work in science or engineering-related sectors instead of (or in addition to)
  space, such as mining, agriculture, health, communications, IT, biotech, chemicals, construction,
  defence, and others. Those with a more artistic nature have been inspired by space to produce
  enduring and inspirational literature, music, and art.</p>

<p>The fact that space research captivates students’ interest greatly facilitates science education.
  Some school science teachers pitch their lessons in the context of space, or even teach dedicated
  space science courses, purely because students perceive space as cool and interesting, which
  engages their attention, enthusiasm, and creativity. Agencies like NASA provide educational
  content and multimedia at no cost, in addition to opportunities for students to engage with
  astronauts and the ISS (International Space Station). College and university students benefit from
  summer programs, internships, and scientific research published by NASA and other space
  agencies.</p>

<h2>Economic returns</h2>

<p>Space research helps to build up a nation’s intellectual capital, providing valuable experience
  for scientists, engineers, and managers who will often migrate from space agencies to science or
  technology-related industries, academia, or the military. Companies, universities, and governments
  then benefit from their unique experience and knowledge, which has positive effects on the
  economy.</p>

<p>People with a background in space are well-respected in the wider community, and with good
  reason: space presents very difficult problems with little room for error. Space research is not
  only a skill-builder but a confidence-builder, and many ex-space-agency people have gone on to
  create innovative new companies that return a tangible economic benefit.</p>

<p>The new technologies that arise from space research also create economic benefits. Commercial
  applications for products spun off from space research lead to the formation of new companies and
  revenue streams.</p>

<h2>Abundant resources</h2>

<p>Space represents a<b> </b>virtually unlimited supply of valuable resources, including energy,
  metals, carbon, water, hydrocarbons, gases, and minerals; the building blocks of every useful
  resource required by civilisation. If the burgeoning human population on Earth is consuming too
  many resources for one planet, as numerous experts claim, then space is the answer. Not only can
  resources from space be used on Earth, but also in space by the new communities we create there.
  Having access to abundant resources for constructing and powering space cities and vehicles will
  give rise to a vibrant space economy and civilisation, ultimately spanning the Solar System.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Metals, carbon, silicon, water, oxygen, ammonia, and more</b> are available in abundance
    from asteroids<b>.</b> There are literally millions of asteroids in our Solar System, many the
    size of large mountains (some much larger), and composed of valuable materials. Metals, carbon,
    and silicon can be used to build space stations and ships, and water and oxygen can provide them
    with propellant and critical life support resources. Ammonia can be used as fuel, fertiliser, or
    a source of nitrogen for air.
  </li>
  <li><b>Solar energy</b> can be collected in space, where the Sun always shines, and without
    impedance by atmosphere or clouds. Solar powered satellites can be placed in the orbits of
    Earth, Luna, Mars, and other worlds, to provide continuous energy to settlements on the surface.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Hydrocarbons</b> can be found on worlds such as Titan. On Earth much of our technology is
    still heavily dependent on hydrocarbons, which we mainly utilise for electricity and heat.
    However, even as we transition to sustainable energy, hydrocarbons will remain important for the
    production of plastics, lubricants, and other products, and are a valuable rocket fuel.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fusion fuels</b> such as deuterium, tritium, and helium-3 (see Table 1, below) can be found
    in lunar regolith and Martian ice, and in virtually unlimited quantities in the atmospheres of
    the giant planets. If fusion becomes a commercially viable energy technology, being space-faring
    will give us access to more fuel than we will ever need. Fusion could be the key to settlement
    of the Outer Solar System, new forms of rapid space propulsion, and interstellar spaceships.
  </li>
  <li><b>Rare earth elements</b>, required for many modern technological products, can be found in
    concentrated deposits on both Luna and Mars. These elements can be difficult to refine and
    recover, which is why concentrated ore deposits are extremely valuable.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the above list shows, one of the most important resources that space gives us is energy,
  whether from the Sun, or from chemical or fusion fuels. With abundant energy, we can make
  virtually anything else.</p>

<p>Having access to the resources of space will enable us to build settlements in space. In this
  way, space settlement is analogous to settlement of the Americas or Australia; on arrival, the
  settlers utilised locally-sourced wood, stone, water, animals, and other resources, to build and
  supply new settlements.</p>

<p>Although space exploration and settlement will initially be supported using resources from Earth,
  once we begin to tap into the resources of space, it will become progressively easier to build and
  do more in space. Luna, Mars, and especially the asteroids, all have much shallower gravity wells
  than Earth, which means extracting resources from these bodies for use in space will eventually be
  much cheaper.</p>

<p>Learning how to access the infinite resources of space should really be our first priority. With
  this achieved, space provides an abundance of all the resources we need to colonise space, and
  also to solve many problems on Earth.</p>

<p>As our technological capability increases we are able to access resources everywhere more easily
  and cheaply, increasing their supply and reducing cost. However, the exponentially-increasing
  demands of our growing population can sometimes be difficult to meet. Access to the resources of
  space, and progressively improving the efficiency with which we can obtain these resources, will
  eliminate that problem, perhaps forever. This abundance will mean an improved quality of life for
  all people and other creatures on Earth, and everywhere else in the Universe where we may
  spread.</p>

<h2>Asteroid defence</h2>

<p>It’s possible that Earth will again be hit by a large asteroid, possibly even as large as the one
  that wiped most life on Earth 66 million years ago.&nbsp; Space research will help to ensure the
  survival of humanity, as well as many other Terran species, once we will learn how to divert PHAs
  (Potentially Hazardous Asteroids) and prevent catastrophic impacts. While major collisions may be
  infrequent, they occur regardless, and the effects can be somewhat disruptive. Advances in
  astronomy are improving our ability to detect potential impactors in advance, and the development
  of an asteroid mining industry may help us develop the ability to redirect them.</p>

<p>It’s fortunate that asteroids are highly valuable, because if we aren’t sufficiently motivated by
  the risk of a major impact to develop the technology to alter asteroid orbits, then the potential
  for vast profits should do the trick.</p>

<p>Space settlement will provide an additional layer of protection, because if an asteroid arrives
  which is too large, or moving too quickly for us to divert, and it hits Earth, then the people
  living in space colonies — especially those on Mars, which have the potential to be
  self-sufficient and independent from Earth — may survive, even if people on Earth do not. This
  underlines the importance of establishing colonies on Mars as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote><i>All civilisations become either spacefaring or extinct.</i> — Carl Sagan</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Asteroids are nature's way of asking: “How's that space program coming along?”</i> —
  Neil de Grasse Tyson
</blockquote>

<h2>Environmental benefits</h2>

<p>Environmental benefits result from space research and settlement. Earth observation satellites
  provide valuable data about climate, the atmosphere, the biosphere and the oceans, which inform
  scientists and policy-makers about climate change and the environment.</p>

<p>Also, because of the advantages of low-gravity environments, and because there aren’t any trees,
  cities, or oceans in the way, it will be possible to eventually move much of our mining and
  manufacturing operations off Earth and into space, thus reducing ecological destruction and
  pollution.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest positive effect on our environment will come from what is called the
  “Overview Effect” (see the book by Frank White, who coined this term), which occurs when people
  view Earth from space. It refers to a profound realisation that Earth is a single living being,
  and that national borders and other divisions between people do not exist in reality. They cannot
  be seen when looking at Earth, but the biosphere and oceans and polar regions can. Many of our
  cultural and societal ideas are based on a belief in separation, particularly between people of
  different nations (or races, religions, etc.), and between people and the planet. These
  separations aren’t actually real, and when seeing the Earth from space, this truth becomes
  apparent. All of us are part of Earth, which is a vast living system. The more people that view
  Earth from space and experience the Overview Effect, the more that the illusion of national
  borders, and the illusion that humans are separate from the biosphere, will dissolve. Not only
  will this increase the number of people who consider themselves citizens of Earth rather than
  their particular nation, it will also result in greater care for the environment, of which
  humanity is an integral part.</p>

<h2>Greater world peace</h2>

<p>Most conflict on Earth is about resources; therefore, access to the infinite resources of space
  will eliminate one of our main causes of conflict. If minerals are available in virtually
  limitless quantities from space, there will be much less interest in invading or seeking influence
  over other nations on Earth. This will lead to greater peace and co-operation worldwide, with a
  corresponding reduction in the associated destruction and wastage of both human and (ironically)
  material resources associated with war.</p>

<p>In addition, history has shown that collaboration in space leads to improved international
  relations. Because human spaceflight is expensive and difficult, only a few nations have yet
  attempted it. To achieve more and learn from each other, they are often eager to cooperate and
  share resources and data. This results in improved outcomes for cooperating nations, including new
  space technology and scientific understanding, and also improves international relationships. All
  major space agencies are currently developing plans for Mars, and almost all have agreed to work
  together.</p>

<p>The space-faring nations are more-or-less, the superpowers of the world. The more these nations
  work together, the less likely they are to engage in major conflict with each other.</p>

<p>One of the great and often unsung benefits of space is the way it brings us all together in a
  grand adventure. Space exploration speaks to something in our souls; perhaps the future truly does
  call to us, or perhaps it’s the stardust in our DNA. You can go to any country in the world and
  find people fascinated by space exploration and settlement, especially students.</p>

<p>Luna and Mars offer so much excitement and possibility that all the major space agencies want to
  be involved in human missions to one or the other or both worlds. The challenge of achieving this
  is great enough that collaboration between them will almost certainly be necessary.</p>

<p>Space settlement may prove to be the key requirement to achieving world peace. Having access to
  the infinite resources of space will effectively remove the boundaries on our ecological niche.
  Combined with ongoing technological development, this will eliminate many causes of conflict among
  humans. Space settlement represents an open future, in contrast to a closed future in which we do
  not expand beyond Earth, but compete more and more intensely for a dwindling supply of resources.
  A closed future is a world of conflict, competition and war. An open future is one where we expand
  into space, and the potential exists to create abundance for all. It’s a future of peace.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we should approach space, and Luna and Mars, as a unified people.</p>
