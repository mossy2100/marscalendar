<p>In the Utopian Calendar, rather than using an era label like BC/BCE or AD/CE as in the Gregorian
  Calendar, mirs are simply numbered using integers, i.e. … –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Defining an
  epoch for the calendar means specifying which mir is numbered 0. As we have already decided that
  the mir begins with the northern vernal equinox (NVE), the next question is which one will define
  the beginning of mir 0.</p>

<p>The Martian NVE that occurred at approximately 12 March 1609, 19:06:20 UTC is used. This
  particular NVE makes a good starting point for the calendar because this is approximately when
  telescopes started being used to study Mars. This epoch is called the <b>Telescopic Epoch</b>.</p>

<p>The year 1609 represented the beginning of a new relationship between humans and Mars. It was the
  year Galileo first started using the newly-invented telescope to observe Mars, as well as other
  planets and moons. It was also the year that Johannes Kepler published <i>Astronomia Nova</i>, in
  which his laws of planetary motion were explained; laws he arrived at by studying Tycho Brahe’s
  observations of Mars.</p>

<p>Before 1609, Mars had only ever been viewed with the naked eye. Selecting the Telescopic Epoch
  for mir numbering means that the dates of all telescopic observations of Mars, and therefore all
  maps, missions, and everything that has happened on Mars since, and that will happen in the
  future, can be expressed with non-negative mir numbers.</p>

<p>The use of this epoch for Martian timekeeping was first suggested in 1999 by Peter Kokh
  (President of the Moon Society for many years).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Coordinated_Mars_Time_.28MTC.29"
  target="_blank">MTC (Coordinated Mars Time)</a> at the NVE was approximately M:991.372 (in <a
  href="/notation">Utopian notation</a>), i.e. almost midnight. The closest midnight is about 13
  minutes later, at approximately <b>12 March 1609, 19:19:06 UTC</b>. This is used as the actual
  starting time of the first sol in mir 0, and thus of the epoch.</p>

<h2>How this epoch was computed</h2>

<p>The astronomer Jean Meeus calculated the equinoxes and solstices of Mars from 1874–2126 and
  published these in <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Astronomical-Table-Sun-Moon-Planets/dp/1942675038" target="_blank"
    title="Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon and Planets by Jean Meeus">Astronomical Tables of
    the Sun, Moon and Planets</a>. They are also available <a
    href="http://ops-alaska.com/time/gangale_mst/VernalEquinox.htm" target="_blank">here</a>, on the
  Martian Time website. Ideally I would have directly computed the Julian Date for the NVE for 1609
  using the same astronomical formulae that Meeus used, but this would have required computational
  resources I do not presently have access to; therefore, for practical purposes, I have taken a
  different approach.</p>

<p>Using these values, I calculated a line of best fit through the data points using the method of
  least squares, to derive a formula relating mir numbers to Julian Dates of Mars&rsquo; northern
  venal equinoxes. Specifying the NVE of 1874 as mir 141 causes the NVE of 1609 to be mir 0. The
  resulting formula is:</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>JD<sub>UTC</sub></td>
    <td>= 686.97103295817 * mir + 2308806.29606</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For mir = 0, the Julian Date for the NVE is therefore 2308806.29606.</p>

<p>Using formulas adapted from <a
  href="https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-3rd-Scientific-Computing/dp/0521880688"
  target="_blank">Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing</a>, the Gregorian
  Calendar datetime corresponding to this Julian Date is found to be 1609-03-12 19:06:20 UTC.</p>

<p>The data points provided by Meeus fit this line very closely, with a maximum error of only about
  ±0.03 days, or 42 minutes and 12 seconds. This may seem a large inaccuracy, but fortunately this
  is not the precise start datetime for the epoch that is required. The task now is to determine the
  closest midnight, which will be the beginning of the first sol in mir 0.</p>

<p>To achieve this, we first need to find the local time at 0°, at the moment of the NVE.</p>

<p>This requires knowing the Julian Date in terms of Terrestrial Time (TT), rather than UTC, as
  these are slightly different due to variations in the length of Earth&rsquo;s day. The difference
  depends how far in the past or future we go.</p>

<p>To calculate ∆T, which is the difference in seconds between TT and UTC, formulae were obtained
  from Morrison and Stephenson (2004) – <em>Historical Values of the Earth&rsquo;s Clock Error ΔT
    and the Calculation of Eclipses</em>.</p>

<p><b>Step 1. Calculate the number of Julian centuries before the start of the year 1820.</b></p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><em>cy</em></td>
    <td>= (1820 - <em>year</em>) / 100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= (1820 - 1609) / 100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2.11</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Step 2. Calculate the difference in seconds between TT (Terrestrial Time) and UTC (Universal
  Coordinated Time).</b></p>

<p>For dates before 1770 the following formula is used:</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><i>∆T</i></td>
    <td>= TT - UTC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -20 + 32 <em>cy</em><sup>2</sup></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -20 + (32 * 2.11<sup>2</sup>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 122 seconds</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The error in this calculation is about 3.6 seconds. (This is determined by another formula
  provided in Morrison &amp; Stephenson: <em>err</em> = 0.8 * <em>cy</em><sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>From this information we can calculate MTC, i.e. the local time at 0° longitude. The algorithm
  for this calculation come from Allison and McEwen, 2000, <a
    href="/sites/default/files/pdf/Allison &amp; McEwen, 2000, A post-Pathfinder evaluation of areocentric solar coordinates with improved timing recipes for Mars seasonal:diurnal climate studies.pdf"
    title="Allison and McEwen, A post-Pathfinder evaluation of aerocentric solar coordinates with improved timing recipes for Mars seasonal/diurnal climate studies"><i>A

    Sunclock — Time on Mars — Algorithm and Worked Examples</a>. This webpage also provides formulae
  for calculating ∆T, but these are only useful for dates from 1770 onwards.</p>

<p><b>Step 3. Calculate the Julian Date in Terrestrial Time.</b></p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>JD<sub>TT</sub></td>
    <td>= JD<sub>UTC</sub> + (<em>∆T</em> / 86400)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2308806.29606 + (122 / 86400)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2308806.29747</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Step 4. Calculate the Mars Sol Date (MSD).</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols" target="_blank">Mars Sol
  Date</a> is a proposed Martian equivalent of the Julian Date. It appears in the Allison and McEwen
  paper, and was presumably invented by them.</p>

<p>The calculation is done by subtracting an offset, then dividing by the number of days per sol
  (1.0274912517).</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>MSD</td>
    <td>= (JD<sub>TT</sub> - 2405522.00288) / 1.0274912517</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= (2308806.29747 - 2405522.00288) / 1.0274912517</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -94128.008628</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><b>Step 5. Calculate MTC (Coordinated Mars Time).</b></p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>MTC</td>
    <td>= MSD - floor(MSD)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -94128.008628 - (-94129)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 0.991372 sols</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>(The function floor() rounds a value down to the nearest integer.)</p>

<p>This gives the time of day as a fraction of a sol. By a remarkable coincidence, the NVE occurred
  just before local midnight at 0° longitude.</p>

<p>As this time is close to midnight, it makes more sense to start the calendar at the midnight
  following this point in time, rather than the one preceding it.</p>

<p>To find the Julian Date of this midnight, we must add the few minutes remaining in the sol to our
  original Julian Date for the NVE. However, since Julian Dates are a number of days, we must first
  convert sols to days. Adding this value gives the Julian Date of midnight.</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>JD<sub>UTC</sub></td>
    <td>= 2308806.29606 + (0.008628 * 1.0274912517)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2308806.30493</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This equals 1609-03-12 19:19:06 UTC.</p>
