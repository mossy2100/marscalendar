<p>The convention used by NASA for marking the time of day on Mars is to use a “stretched clock”.
  Because a sol is 2.75% longer than a day, it can be divided into Martian hours, minutes, and
  seconds that are each 2.75% longer than their Terran counterparts.</p>

<p>However, Mars gives us an opportunity to do things differently, and decimal time is an
  improvement. It has been difficult on Earth to introduce decimal time for the same reason that
  Americans still use miles, i.e. cultural inertia. But on Mars we have the luxury of creating new
  and better systems from scratch, which is, after all, half the reason we’re going to Mars in the
  first place.</p>

<p>The main advantage of having 24 hours in a day is that it is easily divided into 2, 3, or 4 equal
  periods. Sexagesimal minutes and seconds permit hours and minutes to be easily divided into 2, 3,
  4, 5, or 6 equal periods.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage of decimal time in this regard is that dividing time periods by 3 or 6 is
  not as easy. That’s fine; after all, we make do with decimal calculations for every other physical
  measurement. Using decimal time means that calculations producing fractional sols do not then need
  to converted to sexagesimal in order to find the time of day. Internal representations of time,
  whether as sols, millisols, or microsols, can be displayed directly and understood. Decimal time
  is already used in some contexts on Earth; for example, some time tracking systems record
  durations in fractional days or hours, rather than hours, minutes, and seconds.</p>

<p>The decimal clock utilised in the Utopian Calendar is based on French Revolutionary Time,
  introduced in France during the 18<sup>th</sup> century. In French Revolutionary Time, a day was
  divided into 10 decimal hours, each of which were divided into 100 decimal minutes. Each decimal
  minute was further subdivided into 100 decimal seconds. An earlier version of the Darian Calendar
  used the same division of units.</p>

<p>The names of units are copied from Martian clocks described by the great science fiction author
  Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Mars colonisation expert Bruce Mackenzie.</p>

<p>In “The Gods of Mars” (1914), Burroughs describes the Martians’ clock as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Martians divide [the day] into ten equal parts, commencing the day at about 6 A.M. Earth
  time. The zodes are divided into fifty shorter periods [xats], each of which in turn is composed
  of 200 brief periods of time [tals], about equivalent to the earthly second.
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, in Burroughs’ scheme:</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 sol</span>= 10 zodes</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 500 xats</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 000 tals</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 zode</span>= 50 xats</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 10 000 tals</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 xat</span>= 200 tals</p>

<p>The system proposed by Mackenzie is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 sol</span>= 25 horas (from the Greek word for “hour”)</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 quarters</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 1000 mils (or millidays)</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 000 beats</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 hora</span>= 4 quarters (or centidays)</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 40 mils</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 4000 beats</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 quarter</span>= 10 mils</p>

<p><span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 1000 beats</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 mil</span>= 100 beats</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 beat</span>= 10 microdays</p>

<p>The unit “beat” comes from “heartbeat”, since the human heart beats around 100&nbsp;000 times per
  day or sol.</p>

<p>Although it may be useful to have a unit of time similar in duration to an Terran hour, such as
  the “hora”, I have opted for a simpler and fully decimal approach, paralleling French
  Revolutionary Time, which uses the “zode” and “tal” from Burroughs’ clock, and the “mil” from
  Mackenzie’s clock. I've used “microsol” in place of the “microday” from Mackenzie’s
  clock.</p>

<p><strong><span class="tab">1 sol</span>= 10 zodes</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="tab">1 zode</span>= 100 mils</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="tab">1 mil</span>= 100 tals</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="tab">1 tal</span>= 10 microsols</strong></p>

<p>I have favoured Burroughs’ units, because they sound more “Martian”, they predate Mackenzie’s
  work, and simply because I like them and I think we’ll enjoy using these uniquely Martian words.
  Also, these terms commemorate a great science fiction writer who gave the world a fantastic vision
  of Mars.</p>

<p>Mackenzie makes a good point in his paper that the French system never caught on, however, I
  suspect this may have been due to the cultural momentum of 24-hour time among the wider
  population. Martians, however, will initially be small in number, and will have the mindset that
  they are creating a new legacy-free culture. They will expect or even desire to do things
  differently and better than Terrans, and on this basis may be more willing to adopt decimal
  time.</p>

<p>Zodes, mils, and tals are essentially Martian hours, minutes, and seconds. Comparison with Terran
  units gives a feel for how long each of these units is:</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 zode</span>= about 2.5 hours</p>

<p><span class="tab">40 mils</span>= about 1 hour</p>

<p><span class="tab">10 mils</span>= about a quarter hour</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 mil</span>= about 1.5 minutes</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 tal</span>= about 0.9 seconds</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 microsol</span>= about 0.09 seconds</p>

<p>Rather than start the day around 6 a.m. as Burroughs describes, for the purpose of timekeeping
  each sol begins at midnight, as on Earth.</p>
