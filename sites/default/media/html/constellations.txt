Hi Derrick

Regarding areocentric coordinates for constellations, Francois Guesdon did some work on this last
year.  We actually ordered the constellations according to ecliptic R.A., seeing as how the Sun
travels along the path of the ecliptic, so that the calendar becomes sort of like a psuedo-zodiac.
For the ideal balance, we tried to find constellations with ecliptic R.A.s that lay between those of
the zodiacal constellations.  This would result in a "neat" alternating pattern of zodiacal and
non-zodiacal constellations. While this is probably not that important, it would result in at least
the odd month names matching between the Utopian and Darian calendars.

Francois calculated the "areocentric" declination for the constellations we were interested in (I've
attached his results for your interest) so we could eliminate those that were too far north or
south. However, as mentioned in the earlier email, this restriction eliminated some of the most
popular and recognisable constellations and should probably be relaxed. For example, Crux, even
though it would primarily be visible only to people in southern Mars, is one of the most famous and
recognisable constellations and probably would add more value to the calendar than, for example,
Grus.

The only other possible reason to know the areocentric declination would perhaps be to strike a
balance between northern and southern constellations.

Here are Francois' calculations of areocentric declinations, for some of the constellations:

Cygnus 76.1 degrees
Cepheus 72.0
Lyra 60.2 
Cassiopeia 59.8
Draco 57.1
Pegasus 52.9 
Andromeda 52.7
Ursa minor 50.6
Hercules 42.7
Aquila 38.6
Pisces 34.8
Perseus 30.6
Aquarius 24.9
Aries 20.4
Ursa M. 19.5
Bootes 19.2
Capricornus 19.1
Ophiuchus 14.6
Auriga 14.4
Cetus 9.3
Fomalhaut 7.1
Sagittarius 4.2
Taurus 0.5
Gemini -7.1 
Scorpius -10.8
Grus -11.3
Leo -15.1
Eridanus -15.4
Virgo -16.3
Cancer -16.8
Orion -20.2
Libra -21.0
Canis Minor -29.0
Corvus -39.7
Hydra -43.5 
Canis Major -49.1
Centaurus -52.6
Crux -62.3
Puppis -63.7 
LMC (Dorado) -67.0
Vela -74.9
Carina -82.7

For anyone with an interest, here is my current train of thought on this puzzle.

It is really only necessary to select 10 names from a set of 74, as 14 constellations are
more-or-less definite: the 12 in the common zodiac; Ophiuchus, the 13th constellation of the zodiac;
and Orion, the most visible and recognisable constellation of all.

Rather than examine all 74 remaining constellations, some of which are very obscure, here is a list
of all the constellations that have been considered since this topic began, including those used in
the Utopian Calendar, the Martian Dreams calendar, and the calendar Tom designed for Bill Woods:
  Canis Major, Canis Minor, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Bootes, Centaurus, Andromeda, Crux, Cygnus,
  Hercules, Pegasus, Aquila, Lyra, Perseus, Draco, Cassiopeia, Carina, Auriga, Cetus, Monoceros,
  Hydra, Corvus, Lupus, Phoenix, Columba, Lynx, Draco, Eridanus.

I am currently inclined to think the following 4 names would be particularly good choices:
* Canes, to represent both Canis Major and Canis Minor, which contain the v.bright stars Sirius,
  Adhara and Procyon (bright stars here: http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/brightest.html).
* Ursae, to represent both Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, two of the most popular constellations
  (approximate constellation popularity here: http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellationcount_list.html).
* Crux, easily one of the best known and recognisable constellations in the world (appearing on many
  nation's flags), and contains the bright stars Acrux, Becrux and Gacrux.

For the last 7, I think it is between:
Centaurus, Bootes, Aquila, Lyra, Carina, Auriga for containing bright stars. Andromeda, Draco,
Hercules, and Pegasus for being popular and/or recognisable.

* Centaurus, quite a recognisable constellation, and contains two bright stars Rigel Kentaurus and Hadar.
* Bootes is fairly recognisable, and contains Arcturus the 4th brightest star in our sky.
* Aquila, contains the bright star Altair.
* Lyra, somewhat popular and contains the v.bright star Vega (made famous by Carl Sagan's "Contact")
* Carina contains the second-brightest star in our sky, Canopus.
* Auriga contains the sixth-brightest star in our sky, Capella.
* Andromeda, apparently (according to above link) the second most popular constellation, and contains some well-known  galaxies.
* Draco is apparently the 5th most popular constellation (although that section of sky would be well represented by the two bears)
* Hercules and Pegasus are both fairly recognisable and popular.

It would be easy to pick the constellations I "like" but this is far too fuzzy a method for my
brain. I think the most logical choices will become more clear when looking at the distribution of
these interesting constellations in the sky.

Considering the main candidates:
Northern: Cygnus, Lyra, Draco, Pegasus, Andromeda, Ursa Minor, Hercules, Aquila, Pisces, Aquarius,
Aries, Ursa Major, Bootes, Capricornus, Ophiuchus, Auriga, Sagittarius, Taurus.
Southern: Gemini, Scorpius, Leo, Virgo, Cancer, Orion, Libra, Canis Minor, Canis Major, Centaurus,
Crux, Carina

The 18 definites and almost definites include 8 northern and 10 southern (counting Canis Maj and Min
as one, and Ursa Maj and Min as one).

The remaining:
Northern: Cygnus, Lyra, Draco, Pegasus, Andromeda, Hercules, Aquila, Bootes, Auriga.
Southern: Carina

So it would seem Carina is a shoe-in, simply in order to even up the N/S split.  To complete a
selection with an even N/S balance means choosing another southern constellation such as Corvus or
Eridanus.  Eridanus has the bright star Achernar but Corvus is probably easier to spot and is at
least somewhat popular.

Alternatively, it would probably be ok to accept 11 southern constellations and 13 northern, which
allows for choosing 3 from the reduced list of interesting northern constellations above.  Which of
these would make the best choices could probably be determined by looking at the ecplitic R.A.s of
the whole list and trying to find as close as possible to the alternating zodiacal/non-zodiacal
sequence.

Something for another day.
