<p>We stand at the brink of a unique and exciting new era in human evolution. We are breaking the
  bonds of gravity and air, and beginning our expansion into space. Soon, we will become a
  multiplanetary, spacefaring species. As Elon Musk once said, nothing as significant has occurred
  in the history of life on Earth since it crawled out of the sea and onto land.</p>

<p>Of all the worlds we might inhabit, none have received as much attention and enthusiasm as Luna
  and Mars. For numerous reasons these two worlds stand above all other destinations, and it’s where
  we will focus the majority of our attention during the first major phase of human expansion into
  space.</p>

<p>Luna is our satellite and closest companion. There's no question it will be a challenge to
  settle: sometimes very hot, sometimes very cold, airless, bathed in radiation, and short of some
  key resources. However, its perpetual proximity is a tremendous advantage, as it means we can go
  and come back at any time, and more easily support colonies from Earth. Luna is destined to be the
  ultimate destination for space tourism, space industry, space science, and more, in the coming
  years.</p>

<p>There’s something about Mars that is incredibly compelling. Perhaps it’s the twenty-four-hour
  day; the rocky terrain reminiscent of the deserts of Jordan, Arizona or Australia; or the
  colourful sky and dusty breezes. Mars feels very familiar compared to other worlds, much less
  “alien” than any other worlds we know of beyond Earth. It’s a world we intuitively perceive as one
  we will eventually explore and inhabit.</p>

<p>Our species currently faces unprecedented environmental, economic, social, cultural, and
  geopolitical challenges. Yet, at the same time, we are evolving into a truly global culture. The
  growing ubiquity of the internet, emergence of a global language, proliferation of communication
  devices, improved living conditions and international relations, and relative ease of air travel,
  have connected humanity to a degree never before seen. The result is the steady emergence of a new
  global culture based on tolerance, compassion, and consideration for each other and for the
  planetary environment. A new, unformalised system of ethics has tacitly emerged, based on global
  unity and the sanctity of life. The worldwide interconnection of minds is gradually causing the
  concept of disparate, competing nation-tribes to disappear.</p>

<p>Rapid evolution of global communications has led to exponential advancement in every branch of
  science and technology, as well as business and finance. An inspiring and vibrant startup culture
  produces exponential innovation and countless new enterprises every year, delivering a steady
  stream of new products and services to the global market. This is happening in virtually every
  sphere: communications, energy, agriculture, construction, transportation, and many others,
  including space. In fact, 2015 saw greater investment in space than in the previous 15 years
  combined.</p>

<p>For over half a century, the Universe beyond our atmosphere has been the domain of government
  space agencies, beyond the reach of private citizens or enterprise. However, we are now seeing a
  gradual shift into a new paradigm where entrepreneurs are creating their own opportunities in
  space. Companies such as SpaceX, Bigelow Aerospace, Virgin Galactic, Moon Express, Golden Spike,
  Deep Space Industries, Planetary Resources, Shackleton Energy, Astrobotic, ispace, Reaction
  Engines, Ripple Aerospace, and many others are embracing the tremendous opportunities in space.
  Leveraging the current scientific and technological revolution, companies like these are
  developing unique plans for commercial operations in space. The effect is exponential: the more
  space businesses there are, the more opportunities in space become possible, which in turn
  inspires and empowers other entrepreneurs to create yet more space businesses.</p>

<p>Private space enterprise is no longer the domain of the billionaire, either. Thanks to the
  affluent and optimistic venture capital culture that developed during the internet revolution, all
  manner of new technology businesses are finding capital, and even fresh graduates are forming
  space startups. As the space industry grows, investors become more confident in the sector.
  Venture capital funds typically reserve a substantial chunk of their capital for high-risk,
  moonshot ventures, and space is increasingly attracting this money.</p>

<p>The grassroots space settlement movement is playing an important part in evolving and
  communicating the vision. Although the creation of the Mars Society, Artemis Society, National
  Space Society, Planetary Society, and others in the late 20th century brought together and
  stimulated discussion among hundreds of scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts in the US and
  elsewhere, in recent years the social media revolution has engaged technophilic pro-space
  millennials worldwide, taking the conversation to new heights. The infosphere is bubbling over
  with ideas, designs, and plans for free space, Luna, and Mars. A number of popular space
  settlement design competitions have emerged: the ”Cities in Space Competition", part of the annual
  New Worlds conference; the Space Settlement Design Contest, part of ISDC (International Space
  Development Conference); and the Mars City Design Challenge, a worldwide Mars settlement design
  contest that has captured the imagination of hundreds of enthusiastic would-be Mars settlers
  worldwide. The growing enthusiasm for Luna and Mars has produced countless books, websites,
  computer games, board games, documentaries, TV specials, and even independent settlement
  initiatives; and it’s only the beginning.</p>

<p>This influx of ideas, technology, and capital into the space sector, along with the awareness of
  the tremendous business opportunities, not only in resources, but also science, tourism, sport,
  manufacturing, property, transportation and more, is ushering in an unprecedented era of space
  development. It will take us from Earth to Earth orbit, Luna, Mars, the asteroids, and beyond. In
  the 21st century, the Solar System will open up for human settlement. This is a major new chapter
  in human history. In the words of Mike Griffin, former NASA Administrator: “One day there will be
  more people living off Earth than on it.”</p>

<p>Advancements in science and technology are transforming almost every aspect of global society,
  but it will arguably be space settlement that produces some of the greatest long-range benefits
  for humanity, providing us with many of the necessary resources — material, technological and
  intellectual — to overcome the present and future challenges we face on Earth. Space exploration
  and settlement will inspire thousands, perhaps millions, of young people to study STEAM (Science,
  Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) topics, significantly benefiting the global economy and
  environment, as these young minds apply themselves to problems other than space. This effect
  occurred once before, with Apollo, but in our modern, hyperconnected, global society, it will be
  orders of magnitude greater.</p>

<p>Numerous benefits will result from human expansion into space. Perhaps most importantly, the
  propagation of humans and other Terran organisms to new worlds will ensure our long-term survival.
  Developing the technologies for living in space will also open up new niches on Earth, enabling us
  to build settlements on the surface of oceans, underwater, underground, in deserts, and maybe even
  in the air. In addition, learning how to more efficiently utilise and recycle the natural
  resources of Earth will free up more of its surface for supporting a rich and diverse
  biosphere.</p>

<p>The frontier of human expansion has always stimulated innovation and disrupted many aspects of
  society; not only technological, but also economic, political, philosophical, and cultural.
  Because Earth has lacked a physical frontier for some years, the foundational institutions and
  systems that form the bedrock of our societies have not evolved significantly. We may have
  experienced enormous scientific, technological, and philosophical advancements with the potential
  to facilitate the creation of a new and better societal models, but we need fresh territory where
  they can be tried. Free space, Luna, other worlds, and especially Mars, will give us that. The
  space frontier will rekindle the human spirit of creativity and reinvention, providing countless
  opportunities for adventurers, entrepreneurs, technologists and leaders who wish to experience and
  participate in the development of new branches of human culture and civilisation. Perhaps this is
  why space calls to us, and why it has always been a catalyst for peace, innovation, inspiration,
  and evolution. It is our destiny.</p>

<p>The 21st century will forever be remembered as the one during which humanity became
  multiplanetary. Momentum and enthusiasm for space settlement is increasing, as relentless and
  inexorable as a king tide. We are going, and we are going soon.</p>

<p>When Elon Musk gave his presentation about the SpaceX Mars architecture and the ITS at the
  International Astronautical Congress this year, he said: “What I really want to try to achieve
  here is to make Mars seem possible. Make it seem as though it’s something that we can do, in our
  lifetimes. And that you can go. And is there really a way that anyone can go if they wanted to.”
  This idea of generating belief within the public about Mars settlement is of fundamental
  importance. If people don’t believe that something is possible, then they won’t give it serious
  attention, add their own ideas, or invest time or money. We must develop a clear and believable
  vision, in order to attract the attention, enthusiasm, ideas, money, facilities, equipment,
  people, and other resources necessary to make it happen. The most important goal of this book is
  therefore to help everyone believe that we can and will settle space.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this book it simply isn’t practical to run the numbers that would test the
  assumptions presented here, and thus fully validate the plan. It’s simply a first pass; a
  collection of ideas that will hopefully carry us another small step forward towards becoming
  multiplanetary. It’s my hope that we can soon begin creating concrete business plans based on
  ideas like these, and actually commence construction of permanent colonies on Luna and Mars, from
  which a broader effort to study and colonise these worlds and others can proceed.</p>

<p>This particular book does not go into great detail about the development of space civilisation.
  There is not a lot of discussion about law, government, culture, or terraforming, as interesting
  and relevant as those topics are. I have opted to focus on the most important first step, which is
  to establish a foothold, or beachhead, on these two worlds; a permanent human presence. Everything
  else will flow from that: science, industry, and society. We need to think about how thee initial
  settlements can be achieved technically, politically, and financially, as well as efficiently and
  intelligently, so that we get the maximum benefit in the soonest time for the least cost while
  maintaining maximum safety.</p>

<p>Building a settlement on Mars is hard. Even with something like the ITS, the best possible
  outcome will emerge from a stepwise approach. While developing ideas for the book, I realised that
  the “ideal” (in my opinion) program for human expansion into space would include:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Institute for Colonisation and Exploration (ICE)</strong>, a high-fidelity analogue
    space settlement located in the Antarctic Dry Valleys, where questions related to space
    settlement, climate, and planetary science and engineering will be studied.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Serenity</strong>, a settlement located close to the lunar south pole, which will
    serve as a starting point for development the lunar economy while also providing valuable
    experience relevant to the development of a settlement Mars
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise</strong>, a Mars settlement located on the lower north-west slopes of
    Olympus Mons.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Earth Orbit Station (EOS)</strong>, a spherical artificial moon and O’Neill-style
    colony in high Earth orbit at an altitude of approximately 150 000 km.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I will also describe a concept for a future Martian capital city called <strong>Olympia</strong>,
  built inside the caldera of Olympus Mons.</p>

<p>This book focuses primarily on Serenity and Enterprise, as these are the two most important
  settlements to develop, whereas ICE and EOS are less critical. “Serenity” and “Enterprise” are, of
  course, two of the most popular spaceships in science fiction (which I imagine almost all readers
  of this book will know), and they fit this project quite well because they embody powerful and
  relevant ideas. “Serenity” means “a state being calm, peaceful, and untroubled”, which expresses
  the intention to bring peace to humanity by using space settlement to unite us. Luna also has a
  lunar mare called Mare Serenitatis, which means “Sea of Serenity”, so the name fits the general
  lunar theme. “Enterprise” means “a bold or complex project”, which certainly applies to the
  construction of a permanent human settlement on Mars. Also, it will most likely be free enterprise
  that leads the way to new worlds.</p>

<p>The design goals and ideas presented for space settlement emphasise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Private enterprise.</li>
  <li>Self-sufficiency.</li>
  <li>Health and safety.</li>
  <li>Fun and enjoyment.</li>
  <li>Development of the local lunar and Martian economies.</li>
  <li>Development of the broader triplanetary economy.</li>
  <li>A robust broadband Solar System internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>We shall see why these things are all of crucial importance.</p>

<p>You will notice a new term here: “triplanetary”. This refers to the “triplanetary system” of
  Earth, Luna, and Mars, which will be roughly encompass the scope of human civilisation by the end
  of the century, in addition to industrial activity among nearby asteroids.</p>
