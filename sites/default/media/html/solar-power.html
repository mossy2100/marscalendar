<p>Solar power* is likely to be the most popular choice for energy production in space, for a number
  of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solar cells are cheap, simple, low-tech, and easy to manufacture and install.</li>
  <li>Only simple equipment is required, with no moving parts, which is therefore less likely to
    break down than other types of energy production equipment.
  </li>
  <li>Solar cells require little maintenance beyond dust removal, and periodic (every 20+ years)
    replacement of panels.
  </li>
  <li>Solar power is considerably safer than virtually all other forms of energy production.</li>
  <li>Solar cell technology can take many forms, e.g. thin film solar cells, solar fabric, or even
    solar paint. This enables it to be applied in various useful ways, such as vehicle hulls.
  </li>
  <li>The Inner Solar System, where most people will always live, receives abundant solar energy.
  </li>
  <li>Solar cells can be made on Luna or Mars, and possibly even some asteroids, from local
    resources.
  </li>
  <li>Solar energy technology is evolving rapidly due to massive investment. Although this is mainly
    for the benefit of Earth, the technological evolution will also benefit Luna and Mars.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <small>* Technically, perhaps we should say “stellar power”, because “solar power” specifically
    refers to the Sun. However, all stars give off light and heat that can be accessed using solar
    cells (or perhaps I should say “stellar cells”). Once we start expanding beyond the Solar
    System, we’ll use solar power technology to utilise energy from other stars.
  </small>
</p>

<p>Solar power has one major drawback, which is its intermittent nature: electricity is only
  produced when panels are receiving sunlight. Thus, during the lunar or Martian night, or when the
  solar panels are shaded by clouds (in the case of Mars) or dust, they will not produce energy.
  This necessitates some kind of energy storage solution, or pairing of the solar power plant with
  some other energy production method.</p>

<p>Other drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solar panels tend to degrade over time, about 1% per year. After about 20 years, conventional
    panels produce about 80% of the power. However, this slow rate of degradation permits ample time
    to replace, upgrade, and add panels as required, and to develop factories to manufacture solar
    panels from local resources.
  </li>
  <li>Luna and Mars are both quite dusty, which means solar panels will need to be regularly
    cleaned. Unless they are cleaned automatically by a mechanical solution (e.g. compressed air
    jets, robots), settlers will have to take on this responsibility.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Concentrated solar power</h2>

<p>Concentrated solar power (CSP) is a solution to the intermittency issue, enabling solar power
  utilisation around the clock. Solar energy is transformed into thermal energy by concentrating
  sunlight onto molten salt and heating it to hundreds of degrees. Hundreds of mirrors are
  positioned around a tower, which has a large tank at the top containing the molten salt. Sunlight
  reflected onto this tank heats the molten salt, and this heat is used to drive a steam turbine and
  generate electricity. The molten salt retains heat extremely well, which means electricity can be
  generated day and night.</p>

<p>CSP could be a solution to generate electricity during the Martian night. However, the salt may
  not retain heat long enough for electricity production to continue during a lunar night or a
  months-long Martian dust storm.</p>

<h2>Space-based solar power</h2>

<p>With space-based solar power (SBSP), large satellites, called “solar power satellites”, or simply
  “power satellites”, are placed in orbit. They have huge solar panels that collect solar energy
  continuously, unaffected by diurnal cycles or weather. The solar power is converted to microwave
  energy, which is beamed to the surface of the world where rectenna arrays convert it to electrical
  energy. Many people believe that they are the solution to Earth’s energy problems into the
  future.</p>

<p>There are a number of challenges with SBSP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They are high-mass and launching them from Earth would be expensive and difficult.</li>
  <li>If a power satellite is placed in geostationary orbit, then they can transmit power
    continuously to a rectenna array below it, on the surface. However, this is a high altitude and
    the microwave energy can dissipate over this distance. If the satellite is placed at a lower
    altitude, then it won’t always be above the same rectenna array, which introduces a different
    intermittency problem.
  </li>
  <li>Power satellites would need to be long-lasting with low maintenance requirements. However,
    telerobotics or even human crews may still be needed to service the satellites periodically.
  </li>
  <li>The efficiency may not be high enough for them to be practical. First, photons from the Sun
    are converted to electricity by the solar panels. Electricity is converted then to microwave
    photons for the power transmission. Some energy is dissipated in the transmission. Finally, the
    microwave energy is converted back to electricity. These energy transformations are all lossy,
    so that the electrical energy produced is a fraction of the solar energy initially collected.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many great minds are currently working on SBSP satellite designs for Earth, but the cost is high,
  as is the difficulty of testing, even for a small demo. Nonetheless, the benefits of abundant
  clean renewable energy are obvious, and once the cost of access to space is sufficiently reduced,
  it seems likely that SBSP will be developed for Earth, depending on the degree of progress made in
  the meantime with alternatives such as wind, tidal, geothermal, and fusion.</p>

<p>If SBSP is developed for Earth then it may find a use on Mars as well. However, since SBSP
  satellites aren’t even being manufactured on Earth yet, they could be decades away on Mars. It
  won’t be a solution for early settlements.</p>
