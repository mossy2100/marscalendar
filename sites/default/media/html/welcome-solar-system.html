<p>A brief tour of the Solar System may be instructive for people who are new to the topic.</p>

<p>In the near future, perhaps we won’t think of ourselves as being from a particular city or
  country, but from a particular world. We won’t be Australians, Colombians or Kenyans, we’ll be
  Terrans, Martians and Lunans. And perhaps not long after that, we’ll consider ourselves as
  citizens of the Solar System, or Alpha Centauri, or some other star system. Some of us will be
  here for hundreds of years, so we should start getting used to the idea that our home is the Solar
  System, not just Earth.</p>

<h2>Units</h2>

<p>Before we start, it’s useful to know that a number of different units are used when talking about
  distances in the Solar System. These are the most common:</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><b>light-second</b> (ls)</td>
    <td valign="middle">Distance travelled by light in a vacuum in one second;<br>299&nbsp;792&nbsp;km
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><b>gigametre</b> (Gm)</td>
    <td valign="middle">1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;km</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><b>light-minute</b> (lmin)</td>
    <td valign="middle">Distance travelled by light in a vacuum in one minute;<br>18&nbsp;Gm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><b>astronomical unit</b> (AU)</td>
    <td valign="middle">Average distance from Earth to the Sun;<br>150&nbsp;Gm</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Gigametres are a standard SI unit, and therefore useful for certain calculations. Light seconds
  and light minutes are useful for measuring communication times between different places in the
  Solar System. Astronomical units are commonly used for measuring the distances between planets and
  the Sun.</p>

<p>Sometimes “millions of miles” are used for measuring distances in the Solar System, but they
  really shouldn’t be. Space is international, and miles are not part of any international standard
  system of units. In addition, miles are only useful for terrestrial scale measurements, whereas,
  within the International System of Units, prefixes enable the metre to be used for measurements
  from the nanometre to the gigametre scale and beyond.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Solar System has organised itself into three reasonably distinct regions. (The terms used
  here are all explained in the next chapter.)</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <b>Inner Solar System</b>, which includes:
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Sun</b> (also known as <b>Sol</b>) the only star in our star system;</li>
      <li>The four <i>inner</i> or <i>terrestrial</i> planets:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mercury</b>;</li>
          <li><b>Venus</b>;</li>
          <li><b>Earth</b> and its moon <b>Luna</b>;</li>
          <li><b>Mars</b> and its moons <b>Phobos</b> and <b>Deimos</b>;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <b>Asteroid Belt</b> (between about 2.1 and 3.3 AU), which contains the dwarf planet
        <b>Ceres </b>and about a million <i>SSSBs</i> (small Solar System bodies);
      </li>
      <li>Many other asteroids, including <i>NEAs</i> (Near Earth Asteroids), some of which are also
        <i>PHAs</i> (Potentially Hazardous Asteroids);
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <b>Outer Solar System</b>, which includes:
    <ul>
      <li>The four <i>outer</i> or <i>giant</i> planets and associated objects:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Jupiter</b>, its 67 moons and 6178 trojans*;</li>
          <li><b>Saturn</b> and its 62 moons;</li>
          <li><b>Uranus</b>, its 27 moons and 1 trojan;</li>
          <li><b>Neptune</b>, its 14 moons and 13 trojans;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>More than 44&nbsp;000 <b>centaurs</b>, which are SSSBs with a semi-major axis between
        Jupiter and Neptune’s orbits (~5.2 &lt; <i>a</i> &lt; ~30.1). At least some of these exhibit
        characteristics of both asteroids and comets; hence the name.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <b>Trans-Neptunian region</b>, which includes:
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>Kuiper Belt</b>, which comprises minor planets in stable orbits between about 30
        and 50 AU. It contains:
        <ul>
          <li>The dwarf planets <b>Pluto</b>, <b>Haumea</b>, <b>Makemake</b>, and others, and their
            moons.
          </li>
          <li>Lots of SSSBs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <b>Scattered Disc</b>, which comprises minor planets in unstable orbits between about
        30 AU and 100 AU. These orbits are unstable because they come close enough to Neptune that
        its gravity can perturb them. It contains:
        <ul>
          <li>The dwarf planet <b>Eris</b>, and others, and their moons.</li>
          <li>Lots of SSSBs, including comets.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The <b>Hills Cloud</b> (also known as the <b>Inner Oort Cloud</b>), a hypothetical
        disc-shaped region that extends between about 100 - 3000 AU and 20&nbsp;000 to 30&nbsp;000
        AU. It potentially contains billions of minor planets.
      </li>
      <li>The <b>Oort Cloud</b>, a hypothetical spherical region that may extend out as far as 100&nbsp;000
        to 200&nbsp;000 AU. It also may contain billions of minor planets.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <small>* It’s estimated there could be about a million Jupiter trojans larger than 1&nbsp;km in
    diameter. Neptune may have 10 - 100 times more large trojans (&lt; 100&nbsp;km) than Jupiter. No
    Saturnian trojans have yet been discovered, probably because of Jupiter’s gravity.

<h2>Settlement Zones</h2>

<p>Each of these three regions can be divided into two “settlement zones”, to make a total of
  six.</p>

<p>The image below is not to scale, but it gives a good overview of the Solar System and these
  settlement zones:</p>

<img alt="Solar System settlement zones" data-align="center"
  data-caption="Solar System settlement zones" data-entity-type="file"
  data-entity-uuid="bce06cb3-ac9e-4657-80ae-00ae7ce13525"
  src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Solar-System-settlement-zones.jpg"/>

<p>I have assigned each zone a colour:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Yellow Zone</b> (approx. 0 to 0.9 AU). This zone encompasses the Sun, Mercury, and Venus.
    This is the hottest zone and will be the second region of the Solar System that humans begin to
    settle.
  </li>
  <li><b>Green Zone</b> (approx. 0.9 to 3.7 AU). This zone encompasses Earth, Luna, Mars, and the
    Asteroid Belt. This is the most habitable and profitable zone, where at least 90% of our
    activity will be focused during the first major phase of human expansion into space, and
    probably where at least 70% of humans will always live even once we’ve spread throughout the
    Solar System. You are here.
  </li>
  <li><b>Red Zone</b> (approx. 3.7 to 14 AU). This zone encompasses the gas giants Jupiter and
    Saturn. It’s likely to be the more popular region of the Outer Solar System for settlement, and
    the third zone of the Solar System that we expand into.
  </li>
  <li><b>Blue Zone</b> (approx. 14 to 30.4 AU). This zone encompasses the ice giants Uranus and
    Neptune. This zone may eventually be settled, but it will take more time and better propulsion,
    communications, and energy technology. This will be the fourth zone that we settle.
  </li>
  <li><b>Orange Zone</b> (approx. 30.4 to 100 AU). This zone is within the heliopause*, and
    approximately encompasses the Kuiper Belt and Scattered Disc (these groups don’t have
    well-defined boundaries). There are only dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies here.
    Perhaps some will eventually be settled, especially Pluto, but probably not by large numbers of
    people.
  </li>
  <li><b>Purple Zone</b> (approx. 100+ AU). This zone is beyond the heliopause. This is
    interplanetary space, approximately encompassing the Hills and Oort Clouds. It is the largest of
    these zones, the one about which we know the least, and the least likely that humans will ever
    settle.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <small>* The heliopause is where the pressure of the solar wind is balanced by the stellar winds
    of other stars. This is where interstellar space is begins, although not necessarily where the
    Solar System ends.
  </small>
</p>

<p>The Green Zone is the most habitable and valuable in the Solar System. Earth and Mars are the
  most hospitable planets, Luna will be home to hundreds of thousands of people purely by virtue of
  its proximity to Earth and the Sun, and the asteroids represent vast material resources for
  supplying spacecraft and building space infrastructure. We will probably build a base on Ceres,
  expand asteroid mining throughout the Asteroid Belt, and build colonies inside metallic asteroids.
  This zone is where the majority of human activity will be, now and into the future.</p>

<p>At some point, probably in the early 22nd century, human activity will spread into the adjacent
  Yellow and Red Zones.&nbsp; Our pathway into the Solar System will look like this: <b>Green &rarr;
    Yellow &rarr; Red &rarr; Blue</b>. Maybe some people (e.g. hardcore plutophiles) will colonise
  some of the dwarf planets in the Orange Zone in the far future, but probably not the Purple.</p>

<p>Here’s what the distribution of the human population of the Solar System could look like from
  around 2200:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yellow Zone: 5%</li>
  <li>Green Zone: 90%</li>
  <li>Red Zone: 4%</li>
  <li>Blue Zone: 1%</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming we terraform Venus, perhaps by the year 3000 it will look more like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Yellow Zone: 20%</li>
  <li>Green Zone: 70%</li>
  <li>Red Zone: 8%</li>
  <li>Blue Zone: 2%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to settle?</h2>

<p>Several key factors will determine our preferences as to where in the Solar System we will
  settle:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Proximity.</b> To reduce transportation and communication times, we will naturally favour
    nearby locations. Therefore, we will initially target the Terran System (i.e. the Earth-Luna
    System), then expand into other parts of the Inner Solar System.
  </li>
  <li><b>Energy.</b> The Sun is a valuable source of light and heat, which has important
    psychological benefits in addition to being valuable for photosynthesis and solar power. The
    Inner Solar System has much more solar energy than the Outer Solar System, which means, until
    fusion or some other exotic method of energy production is developed, it will probably be
    favoured.
  </li>
  <li><b>Resources.</b> Space settlement requires material resources such as water and other
    volatiles*, metals, carbon, and other elements necessary for life and industry. Thus, planets,
    moons, and asteroids will be preferred to free space, particularly those rich in the most
    essential resources such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
  </li>
  <li><b>Gravity.</b> The optimum gravity level for human exploration will be close to Earth level,
    or ideally somewhat less, as this will better support the use of spacesuits. If the gravity is
    too high, then it won’t be practical to work in spacesuits on the surface. If it’s too low, then
    settlers may suffer excessive bone and muscle loss, potentially preventing them from returning
    to Earth (at least until the technology is available to solve this problem). With this in mind,
    terrestrial planets will be preferred, followed by some of the larger dwarf and satellite
    planets.
  </li>
  <li><b>Radiation protection.</b> The interplanetary medium is a high radiation environment, which
    can damage DNA and increase the risk of cancer. We will therefore favour planets and moons with
    thick atmospheres (Earth, Venus, Titan), living underground (any minor or terrestrial planet, or
    moon), or farther from the Sun (Callisto, Titan).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <small>* Volatiles are small molecules with low boiling points, normally associated with planetary
    surfaces or atmospheres, such as hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), helium (He), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>),
    nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), argon (Ar), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon
    dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), neon (Ne), sulphur
    dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S), hydrogen chloride (HCl), and
    hydrogen fluoride (HF).
  </small>
</p>

<p>Considering all these factors, the terrestrial planets and asteroids of the Inner Solar System
  are the most favourable destinations for settlement. Although this is the smallest of the three
  regions of the Solar System, it’s where everyone currently lives, and even as we expand throughout
  the Solar System, it will probably always be where most people live.</p>

<p>Mercury and Venus, however, present unique challenges that will defer their settlement. Mercury
  is baking hot, receiving almost 7 times the solar irradiance of Earth or Luna. Venus is even
  hotter, with a super-high density atmosphere, and thick clouds that obscure visibility of the
  surface from space. This is why we focus on Luna and Mars. As we settle Luna and Mars, the
  asteroid mining will evolve and expand outwards towards the motherlode of the Asteroid Belt, where
  we will establish bases on Ceres, Psyche, and other asteroids.</p>

<p>The worlds of the Inner Solar System have the advantages of abundant solar energy, proximity to
  Earth, planets with decent gravity, and abundant resources from asteroids. The Outer Solar System
  has different advantages, that will become more important in the future: numerous worlds to
  settle, amazing views of the giant planets, lower radiation (excluding the radiation belts around
  Jupiter), and abundant resources available from the atmospheres, moons, rings, and trojans of the
  giant planets.</p>

<h2>Communication times</h2>

<p>Communication between space settlements and Earth will be a particularly important consideration.
  I’ve added this little section to expand on this topic, and emphasise why proximity is not only
  important for reducing time spent in interplanetary space when travelling to and from settlements,
  but also for communications between settlements and Earth, which will be a much more frequent
  consideration.</p>

<p>Communication means mission support; information, data, and content; education; participation in
  human culture, politics, and economics; and connection to friends, family, and humanity as a
  whole. This has major implications for safety, emergency response, psychological health, and the
  successful development of the Solar System.</p>

<p>Electromagnetic radiation such as light and radio signals travel at the speed of light, which is
  about 300&nbsp;000&nbsp;km/s or 18&nbsp;Gm/min. You can therefore calculate the time it takes to
  send messages between points in space by calculating the light travel time.</p>

<p>For example, the average distance between Earth and Luna is about 384&nbsp;400&nbsp;km. Thus, it
  takes about 1.3 seconds to send a message between Earth and Luna. It can take more than 3 seconds
  between speaking and hearing a reply, which may be inconvenient, but no worse than international
  phone calls once were, or VoIP calls between some remote areas are today.</p>

<p>The distance between Earth and Mars varies between approximately 75 to 375&nbsp;Gm during their
  26-month synodic period, which means it takes between about 4 and 21 minutes for a radio signal to
  travel between Mars and Earth. This makes real-time conversation difficult, as it can take more
  than 40 minutes between speaking and hearing a reply from Earth.</p>

<p>Real-time conversations are therefore possible between Earth and Luna, as they were during the
  Apollo missions. However, communications between Earth and Mars will tend towards asynchronous
  modes of communication such as email. People living on Luna will be able to browse the Earthside
  web directly, with a delay in page retrieval times comparable to the early days of the internet,
  although local caches will be employed to reduce this. On Mars, local caches of popular websites
  and content will be essential; for more obscure content it could mean significant wait times as
  pages or whole sites are downloaded, and normal web-browsing will not be possible.</p>

<p>Communication speeds may not be limited to light speed for ever. New space communications
  technologies based on quantum entanglement, for instance, could enable instantaneous
  communications across interplanetary distances.</p>
