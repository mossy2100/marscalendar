<p>The convention used by NASA for marking the time of day on Mars is to use a “stretched clock”.
  Because a sol is 2.75% longer than a day, it can be divided into Martian hours, minutes, and
  seconds that are each 2.75% longer than their Terran counterparts.</p>

<p>However, Mars gives us an opportunity to do things differently, and decimal time is an
  improvement. It has been difficult on Earth to introduce decimal time for the same reason that
  Americans still use miles, i.e. cultural inertia. But on Mars we have the luxury of creating new
  and better systems from scratch, which is, after all, half the reason we’re going there in the
  first place.</p>

<p>The main advantage of having 24 hours in a day is that it is easily divided into 2, 3, or 4 equal
  periods. Sexagesimal minutes and seconds permit hours and minutes to be easily divided into 2, 3,
  4, 5, or 6 equal periods.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage of decimal time in this regard is that dividing time periods by 3 or 6 is
  not as easy. That’s fine, however; after all, we make do with decimal calculations for every other
  physical measurement. Using decimal time means that calculations producing fractional sols do not
  then need to converted to sexagesimal in order to find the time of day. Internal representations
  of time, whether as sols, millisols, or microsols, can be displayed directly and understood.
  Decimal time is already used in some contexts on Earth; for example, some time tracking systems
  record durations in fractional days or hours, rather than hours, minutes, and seconds.</p>

<p>The decimal clock utilised in the Utopian Calendar is similar to French Revolutionary Time
  introduced in France during the 18<sup>th</sup> century. A day was divided into 10 decimal hours,
  each of which were divided into 100 decimal minutes. Each decimal minute was further subdivided
  into 100 decimal seconds. An earlier version of the Darian Calendar used this same division of
  units.</p>

<p>Decimal clocks for Mars have been proposed numerous times, but two that I especially liked, and
  that provided inspiration, are those described by the great science fiction author Edgar Rice
  Burroughs, and Mars colonisation expert Bruce Mackenzie.</p>

<p>In “The Gods of Mars” (1914), Burroughs describes the Martians’ clock as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Martians divide [the day] into ten equal parts [zodes], commencing the day at about 6
  A.M. Earth time. The zodes are divided into fifty shorter periods [xats], each of which in turn is
  composed of 200 brief periods of time [tals], about equivalent to the earthly second.
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, in Burroughs’ scheme:</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 sol</span>= 10 zodes
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 500 xats
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 000 tals
</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 zode</span>= 50 xats
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 10 000 tals
</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 xat</span>= 200 tals</p>

<p>A “zode” is thus one tenth of a sol, i.e. a decisol, and a “tal” is 10<sup>-5</sup> sols, or 10
  microsols.</p>

<p>The clock described by Mackenzie is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 sol</span>= 25 horas
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 quarters
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 1000 mils
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 000 beats
</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 hora</span>= 4 quarters
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 40 mils
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 4000 beats
</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 quarter</span>= 10 mils
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 1000 beats
</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 mil</span>= 100 beats
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">1 beat</span>= 10 microdays
</p>

<p>The word “hora” is Greek for “hour”, and the unit “mil” is an abbreviation of “milliday”. The
  unit “beat” comes from “heartbeat”, since the human heart beats around 100&nbsp;000 times per day
  or sol. A beat is equal to Burroughs’ tal. Mackenzie also offered “centiday” as an alternative
  unit for “quarter”.</p>

<p>Although it may be useful to have a unit of time similar in duration to an Terran hour, such as
  the “hora”, I have opted for a simple, fully decimal approach, with units derived using SI
  prefixes.</p>

<p><b><span class="tab">1 sol</span>= 10 decisols
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100 centisols
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 1000 millisols
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 100&nbsp;000 tals
  <br/>
  <span class="tab">&nbsp;</span>= 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 microsols</b></p>

<p>Because there is no SI prefix for 10<sup>-5</sup>, I’ve used the unit “tal” from Burrough’s
  clock. This serves as a convenient unit similar in duration to the second. The unit name “beat”
  from Mackenzie’s clock could also serve, but “tal” is less ambiguous, and “beat” is already used
  as a different unit of time; viz. decimal minutes in the Internet Time system introduced by the
  Swiss watch company Swatch in 1998.</p>

<p>I expect that in everyday language the Martians will use Mackenzie’s abbreviation “mil” for
  “millisol”. They may abbreviate “decisol” as “deci”, or they may even adopt the very
  Martian-sounding term “zode”.</p>

<p>Mackenzie notes in his paper that the French system never caught on, however, I suspect this may
  have been due to the cultural momentum of 24-hour time among the wider population. Martians,
  however, will initially be small in number, and will have the mindset that they are creating a new
  legacy-free culture. They will expect or even desire to do things differently and better than
  Terrans, and on this basis may be more willing to adopt decimal time.</p>

<p>Comparison with Terran units gives a sense for how long each of these units is:</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 decisol</span>= about 2.5 hours</p>

<p><span class="tab">40 mils</span>= about 1 hour</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 centisol</span>= about 15 minutes</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 millisol</span>= about 1.5 minutes</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 tal</span>= about 1 second</p>

<p><span class="tab">1 microsol</span>= about 0.1 seconds</p>

<p>Rather than start the day around 6 a.m. as Burroughs describes, each sol begins at midnight, as
  on Earth.</p>
