<h2>Dates and datetimes</h2>

<p>The standard notations for Utopian dates and datetimes are similar to the international standard
  <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a> for Gregorian
  equivalents, with a few differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Martian mir numbers, dates, datetimes, and times are prefixed with ‘<b>M</b>’, to indicate
    Mars, and to distinguish them from Terran equivalents.
  </li>
  <li>Mir numbers do not need to be zero-padded to a fixed number of digits. The current mir number
    (216 at the time of writing) has 3 digits, but this is written as <b>M216</b>, not M0216. When
    it reaches 1000, it will be <b>M1000</b>. This is for future-proofing. Eventually mir numbers
    will have 4 digits, 5 digits, and so on. (It’s a flaw in ISO 8601 that years must be expressed
    as exactly four digits, because the standard will not work from the year 10 000. The creators
    created a Y10K problem, which will affect many databases and systems.)
  </li>
  <li>The first mir in the epoch is <b>M0</b>.</li>
  <li>Negative mir numbers indicate mirs before the start of the epoch, e.g. <b>M–100</b>. There is
    no equivalent of BC/AD or BCE/CE notation.
  </li>
  <li>As with Terran years, thousands separators are not used in mir numbers, e.g. <b>M12345</b>
    (not M12,345 or M12.345 or M12 345).
  </li>
  <li>The date separator character is ‘<b>/</b>’ (forward slash). On Earth we different date
    separators in different countries, including ‘<b>–</b>’ (hyphen, dash, or minus sign), ‘<b>/</b>’
    (forward slash), and ‘<b>.</b>’ (period or decimal point). The ISO 8601 standard uses the dash
    (e.g. “2016-12-06”). However, the hyphen and period characters have other meanings within the
    Mars datetime format, as a negative sign and a decimal point respectively, therefore we must
    choose an alternative for clarity. The forward slash is the most obvious choice, as it clearly
    indicates a date when used in this way. A different character could potentially be used, e.g.
    216^17^22 or 216*17*22, but this might be tedious to write, less likely to be adopted, less
    obviously a date, and unclear as to meaning. The <b>M</b> prefix will prevent confusion with
    Terran dates better than an unusual separator.
  </li>
  <li>As in ISO 8601, the date parts are arranged from most to least significant, i.e. <b>M</b>{mir}<b>/</b>{month}<b>/</b>{sol},
    e.g. <b>M216/24/17</b>.
  </li>
  <li>As in ISO 8601, month and sol parts of the date are zero-padded to 2 digits, e.g. <b>M216/01/05</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Times are usually displayed with microsol resolution by showing the number of millisols to 3
    decimal places. Both the number of millisols and microsols are zero-padded to 3 digits, e.g. <b>012.345,
      888.222, 500.000</b>.
  </li>
  <li>A date and time can be combined into a single datetime string using the ‘<b>:</b>’ (colon) as
    a separator between the date and the time, e.g. <b>M216/17/22:123.456</b>. (This part of the
    notation was introduced by the <a href="http://mars-sim.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Mars
      Simulation</a> project, and it works very well.)
  </li>
  <li>When displayed without a date, Martian times are prefixed with ‘<b>M:</b>’ to distinguish them
    from ordinary numbers, e.g. <b>M:012.345, M:567.222</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Times can also be shown with only millisol resolution, e.g. <b>M:012</b>, <b>M:777</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Long date format</h2>

<p>The long date format looks like:</p>

<p class="indent"><b>M</b>{mir} {monthName} {sol}</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p class="indent"><b>M216 Tucana 24</b></p>

<p>The ‘<b>M</b>’ prefix in front of the mir indicates a Martian date, and eliminates confusion
  about which number refers to the mir and which to the sol.</p>
