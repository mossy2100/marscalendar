<h2>Tropical and calendar mirs</h2>

<p>The average length of a year in the Gregorian Calendar (the most commonly used calendar on Earth)
  is 365.2425 days. This is very close to the average period between northern hemisphere vernal
  equinoxes, which is 365.242 374 days. The same approach is used in the Darian and Utopian
  Calendars.</p>

<p>The vernal equinox is precise moment that defines the beginning of spring in the northern
  hemisphere. At this moment, Earth’s axis is side-on to the Sun, and the day will have an equal
  period of darkness and light. After the northern vernal equinox, nights will begin getting shorter
  in the northern hemisphere, and longer in the southern.</p>

<p>This particular seasonal marker is chosen because it’s when astronomers mark the beginning of the
  astronomical year, when Ls = 0°. “Ls” refers to the <i>longitude of the Sun</i>, which means the
  position of the Sun against the backdrop of fixed stars from the perspective of a location on
  Earth, Mars, or elsewhere in the Solar System. During the year, Ls increases to 360°.</p>

<p>The average period between northern vernal equinoxes on Mars is 668.5907 sols, and this is used
  as the basis for the length of the calendar mir length in the Darian and Utopian Calendars. The
  calendar mir is a whole number of sols, just like the calendar year on Earth is a whole number of
  days.</p>

<h2>Short and long mirs</h2>

<p>To ensure the average calendar mir length is 668.5907 sols, a pattern of “short” mirs of 668 sols
  and “long” mirs of 669 sols is defined. The adjectives “common” and “leap”, which we use with
  years, aren’t suitable for mirs because short mirs occur less frequently than long mirs.</p>

<p>The Darian calendar specifies a system of rules similar to those used by the Gregorian Calendar
  to determine when a calendar mir is short or long. These rules produce an average calendar mir
  length of 668.591 sols per mir, which is very close to the average northern vernal equinox
  mir:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A mir is short unless one of the following rules applies. (668 sols/mir)</li>
  <li>Odd-numbered mirs are long. (668 + 0.5 = 668.5 sols/mir)</li>
  <li>Mirs divisible by 10 (ending in 0) are also long. (668.5 + 0.1 = 668.6 sols/mir)</li>
  <li><i>Except</i>, mirs divisible by 100 (ending in 00) are short. (668.6 - 0.01 = 668.59
    sols/mir)
  </li>
  <li><i>Except</i>, mirs divisible by 1000 (ending in 000) are long. (668.59 + 0.001 = 668.591
    sols/mir)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There is a difference of 668.591 - 668.5907 = 0.0003 sols, or about 27 seconds, per mir. After
  2000 mirs, the error will have accumulated to about 0.6 sols (almost 15 hours), after which time
  the intercalation rules change.</p>

<p>In 2006 Tom extended the intercalation rules for the first 10 000 mirs, to allow for the slowly
  increasing length of the Martian northern vernal equinox mir:</p>

<p>Only the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> rules (above) need to be altered, and only every 2000
  mirs, with the result that the error is only about 1 sol after 12&nbsp;000 mirs.</p>

<p>The extra or <i>intercalary</i> sol, the 669<sup>th</sup> sol of the mir in a long mir, is added
  to the last month of the mir. Aside from the logic and benefits of doing this, it reflects the
  early Roman calendar, when March was the first month of the year. (January and February were added
  to the original 10-month calendar around 713 BC. As the standard calendar year was only 355 days,
  it would fall out of sync with the seasons, so the Romans would periodically add extra days into
  February to resynchronise it. February was the last month of the year up until about 450 BC, when
  it became the second month.)</p>

<h2>Start of the mir</h2>

<p>As above, the calendar mir begins at (within a sol of) the northern hemisphere vernal equinox,
  when Ls = 0°. This marks the beginning of the spring in the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>There is a poetic bonus gained by choosing to begin the mir with the northern spring. On Earth
  the northern spring begins in March, with the vernal equinox occurring on or close to March 20. In
  the early Roman calendar March was the first month of the year; thus, the year ended with winter
  and began with spring. March was named for the god Mars, who was originally the Roman god of
  springtime before he became the god of war. Thus, it’s quite appropriate to begin the new mir at
  the beginning of spring, which is the god Mars’ season.</p>
