<p>For some reason, timekeeping for Mars was one of the first aspects of Mars settlement that really
  fascinated me, and I ended up putting put a lot of thought into it. The calendar presented here is
  the result of a long period of research and experimentation. Many people have shown interest and
  enthusiasm for the calendar and the timekeeping system, and it has appeared in several software
  applications, websites, and games, including the <a href="http://mars-sim.sourceforge.net/"
    target="_blank">Mars Simulation Project</a> and the <a

    Calendar</a> iPhone app.</p>

<p>Please use the table of contents in the sidebar to navigate the description of the calendar and
  clock. I hope you enjoy learning about timekeeping on Mars!</p>
