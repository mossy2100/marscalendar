<p>In the Utopian Calendar, rather than using an era label like BCE or CE as in the Gregorian
  Calendar, mirs are simply numbered using integers, i.e. … –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Defining an
  epoch for the calendar means specifying which mir is numbered 0. As we have already decided that
  the mir begins with the northern vernal equinox (NVE), the next question is which one will define
  the beginning of mir 0.</p>

<p>The Martian NVE that occurred at approximately 12 March 1609, 7:06:46 UTC is used. This
  particular NVE makes a good starting point for the calendar because this is approximately when
  telescopes started being used to study Mars. This epoch is called the <b>Telescopic Epoch</b>.</p>

<p>The year 1609 represented the beginning of a new relationship between humans and Mars. It was the
  year Galileo first started using the newly-invented telescope to observe Mars, as well as other
  planets and moons. It was also the year that Johannes Kepler published <i>Astronomia Nova</i>, in
  which his laws of planetary motion were explained; laws he arrived at by studying Tycho Brahe’s
  observations of Mars.</p>

<p>Before 1609, Mars had only ever been viewed with the naked eye. Selecting the Telescopic Epoch
  for mir numbering means that the dates of all telescopic observations of Mars, and therefore all
  maps, missions, and everything that has happened on Mars since, and that will happen in the
  future, can be expressed with non-negative mir numbers.</p>

<p>The use of this epoch for Martian timekeeping was first suggested in 1999 by Peter Kokh
  (President of the Moon Society for many years).</p>

<p>The sol during which this particular NVE occurred is therefore the first sol of mir 0. The <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Coordinated_Mars_Time_.28MTC.29"
  target="_blank">MTC (Coordinated Mars Time)</a> at this particular point in time was approximately
  M:495.010 (in <a href="/notation">Utopian notation</a>), i.e. shortly after midday. The actual
  start point of the calendar is the start of this sol, about half a sol earlier, at approximately
  11 March 1609, 18:54:21 UTC.</p>

<p>Although I have shown this datetime accurate to the second, it&rsquo;s probably only accurate to
  about a minute. It is difficult to perform this calculation with a high degree of accuracy because
  of the method used. Future calculations will refine this value, but for now it will suffice.</p>

<h2>How this epoch was computed</h2>

<p>The noted astronomer Jean Meeus calculated the equinoxes and solstices of Mars from 1874–2126 and
  published these in <a
    href="https://www.amazon.com/Astronomical-Table-Sun-Moon-Planets/dp/1942675038" target="_blank"
    title="Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon and Planets by Jean Meeus">Astronomical Tables of
    the Sun, Moon and Planets</a>. They are also available <a
    href="http://ops-alaska.com/time/gangale_mst/VernalEquinox.htm" target="_blank">here</a>, on the
  Martian Time website. Ideally I would have directly computed the Julian Date for the NVE for 1609
  using the same astronomical formulae that Meeus used, but this would have required computational
  resources I do not presently have access to; therefore, for practical purposes, I have taken a
  different approach.</p>

<p>Using these values, I calculated a line of best fit through the data points using the method of
  least squares, to derive a formula relating mir numbers to Julian Dates of Mars&rsquo; northern
  venal equinoxes. Specifying the NVE of 1874 as mir 141 causes the NVE of 1609 to be mir 0. The
  resulting formula is:</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td>JD<sub>UT</sub></td>
    <td>= 686.971033153 * mir + 2308805.79636</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For mir = 0, the Julian Date for the NVE is therefore 2308805.79636.</p>

<p>Using formulas adapted from <a
  href="https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-3rd-Scientific-Computing/dp/0521880688"
  target="_blank">Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing</a>, the Gregorian
  Calendar datetime corresponding to this Julian Date is found to be 12 March 1609, 7:06:46 UTC.
</p>

<p>The data points provided by Meeus fit this line very closely, with a maximum error of only about
  &plusmn;0.03 days, or 43 minutes and 12 seconds. This may seem a large inaccuracy, but fortunately
  this is not the precise start datetime for the epoch that is required. The task now is to
  determine the start of that sol on Mars, which we can calculate with slightly better accuracy, and
  will be the same even if the calculation of the NVE is off by as much as 42.3 minutes.</p>

<p>From the Julian Date for the NVE we can calculate MTC, i.e. the local time of sol at 0°
  longitude. The original formulae to make this calculation come from Allison and McEwen, 2000, <a
    href="/sites/default/files/pdf/Allison &amp; McEwen, 2000, A post-Pathfinder evaluation of areocentric solar coordinates with improved timing recipes for Mars seasonal:diurnal climate studies.pdf"
    title="Allison and McEwen, A post-Pathfinder evaluation of aerocentric solar coordinates with improved timing recipes for Mars seasonal/diurnal climate studies"><i>A
    post-Pathfinder evaluation of aerocentric solar coordinates with improved timing recipes for
    Mars seasonal/diurnal climate studies</i></a>, although updates to the formulae have since been
  made, as described at this page on the NASA Goddard website: <a
    href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/algorithm.html" target="_blank">Mars24
    Sunclock — Time on Mars — Algorithm and Worked Examples</a>.</p>

<p>The local time of sol is calculated as follows.</p>

<p><b>Step 1. Calculate the number of Julian centuries before the start of the year 2000.</b></p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td><i>T</i></td>
    <td>= (JD<sub>UT</sub> - 2451545.0) / 36525</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= (2308805.79636 - 2451545.0) / 36525</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -3.90798641025</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b>Step 2. Calculate the difference in seconds between TT (Terrestrial Time) and UTC (Universal
  Coordinated Time).</b></p>

<p>For dates before 1972, the following formula is used:</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td><i>D</i></td>
    <td>= TT - UTC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 64.184 + 59 <i>T</i> - 51.2 <i>T</i><sup>2</sup> - 67.1 <i>T</i><sup>3</sup> - 16.4
      <i>T</i><sup>4</sup></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Substituting our calculated value for <i>T</i> gives <i>D</i> = -768.74 seconds.</p>

<p>Note, this is only an approximate value. The Mars24 Sunclock page doesn&rsquo;t indicate the
  level of accuracy for this formula when used with 17<sup>th</sup>-century datetimes, however, to
  give you some indication, the earlier formula given in the original Allison and McEwen paper is
  accurate to within 11 seconds for 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century dates. The updated
  formula is more accurate, but at the same time, the further back in the past, the greater the
  inaccuracy. The result is probably only accurate to within about 10–20 seconds.</p>

<p><b>Step 3. Calculate the Julian Date in Terrestrial Time.</b></p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td>JD<sub>TT</sub></td>
    <td>= JD<sub>UT</sub> + (<i>D</i> / 86400)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2308805.79636 + (-768.74 / 86400)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2308805.78747</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b>Step 4. Calculate the Mars Sol Date (MSD).</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Sols" target="_blank">Mars Sol
  Date</a> is a proposed Martian equivalent of the Julian Date. It appears in the Allison and McEwen
  paper, and was presumably invented by them or someone in the Pathfinder team.</p>

<p>This calculation is done by subtracting an offset, then dividing by the number of days per sol
  (1.0274912517).</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td>MSD</td>
    <td>= (JD<sub>TT</sub> - 2405522.0028779) / 1.0274912517</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= (2308805.78747 - 2405522.0028779) / 1.0274912517</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -94128.50499</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b>Step 5. Calculate MTC (Coordinated Mars Time).</b></p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td>MTC</td>
    <td>= MSD - floor(MSD)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= -94128.50499 - (-94129)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 0.49501 sols</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>(The function floor() rounds a value down to the nearest integer.)</p>

<p>This gives the time of day as a fraction of a sol. Therefore, the NVE occurred just before noon
  on this sol.</p>

<p>The final step is to calculate the Julian Date of the start of that sol (i.e. midnight), which
  will mark the beginning of the first sol of mir 0.</p>

<p>Since Julian Dates are a number of days, we need to subtract a value in days from the Julian Date
  of the NVE to find the Julian Date at M:000.000 on that particular sol. This can be calculated by
  converting the time of sol to days:</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td>MTC<sub>days</sub></td>
    <td>= 0.49501 / 1.0274912517</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 0.50862 days</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Subtracting this value gives the Julian Date of midnight on sol 1 of mir 0:</p>

<table class="calculation">
  <tr>
    <td>JD<sub>UT</sub></td>
    <td>= 2308805.79636 - 0.50862</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>= 2308805.28774</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This equals 11 March 1609, 18:54:21 UTC.</p>
