<p>Before we I can explain how the calendar works, it is useful to review the Martian astronomical
  cycles on which it is based, and the units used in the explanation of the calendar.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Martian day is called a “<strong>sol</strong>”, and has an average duration of <strong>88
    775.244 09 seconds</strong>, which is <strong>1.027 49 days</strong>, or <strong>24 hours, 39
    minutes, and 35.244 09 seconds</strong>. Thus,&nbsp;a sol is only about 40 minutes longer than
    an Earth day. The word “sol” was introduced by NASA, and has been used to refer to a Martian
    solar day since the Viking missions.&nbsp;The fact that a sol is almost the same length as a
    Terran day is tremendously convenient when designing a calendar, because it permits the creation
    of one very similar to those we’re already familiar with, which have as their fundamental unit
    the Terran solar day, the dominant cycle of human behaviour and society.
  </li>
  <li>Each sol is divided into <strong>decisols</strong>, <strong>millisols</strong>, and <strong>tals</strong>.
    This is discussed further in the section about <a href="/time-sol">Time of the sol</a>.
  </li>
  <li>As part of this calendar I introduced the term “<strong>mir</strong>” for “Martian year”.
    “Mir” is a Russian word that means “world”, “peace”, and “community”, and was the name of the
    gone-but-never-forgotten legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir" target="_blank">Russian
      space station</a>. It means “community” in the sense of a community combining their efforts
    for a common task, such as building a church or clearing a field. The word “mir” not only sounds
    like a perfect contraction of “Martian year”, but also invokes the spirit of a group working
    together with the common cause of developing Mars into a peaceful world community.&nbsp;A mir
    has about <strong>668.5907&nbsp;sols</strong> on average, which is equal to about&nbsp;<strong>687
      days</strong> or <strong>1.88 years</strong>. With <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Prefixes" target="_blank">SI
      prefixes</a>&nbsp;the terms <strong>decamir</strong>, <strong>hectomir</strong>, and <strong>kilomir</strong>
    are derived, for Martian decade, century, and millennium.
  </li>
  <li>Martian&nbsp;“<strong>weeks</strong>” and “<strong>months</strong>” do not refer to precise
    periods of time,&nbsp;but rather to periods similar in duration and purpose to weeks and months
    on Earth.
  </li>
</ul>
