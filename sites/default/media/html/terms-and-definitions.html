<p>In the previous chapter, several terms were used to describe the different types of objects in
  the Solar System: star, planet, moon, asteroid, trojan, centaur, comet and so on. The definitions
  of these terms can sometimes be confusing or unobvious, so we will review them briefly.</p>

<h2>Planet</h2>

<p>The meaning of the word “planet” has evolved over the years, and when talking about the Solar
  System it’s often used in confusing ways. For example, why do we say Pluto is not a planet, but is
  a dwarf planet? How can a “dwarf planet” not be a “planet”? In this section I will attempt to
  explain what both astronomers and normal people mean by the word “planet”.</p>

<p>“Planet” initially meant “wanderer”, as they referred to the points of light that moved across
  the sky, in contrast to the stars and constellations that appeared fixed in place.</p>

<p>The definitive difference between a planet and a star is that a star has achieved <b>stellar
  nucleosynthesis</b>, which is to say, it’s so large that its gravity is powerful enough to fuse
  atomic nuclei together into larger ones. When a nuclear fusion reaction occurs, a tiny bit of mass
  is converted to energy according to Einstein’s formula E=mc<sup>2</sup>, when is then released in
  the form of light, heat and other forms of radiation. This is why stars give off light and heat.
  Any object not large enough for stellar nucleosynthesis is called a <b>substellar object</b>.</p>

<p>The current definition of a <b>planet</b>, according to the IAU (International Astronomical
  Union), is an object that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orbits the Sun.</li>
  <li>Is <b>gravitationally rounded</b>, which is to say, its mass is large enough for gravity to
    have pulled it into an ellipsoidal* shape. This is also known as <b>hydrostatic equilibrium</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Has cleared its orbital neighbourhood of smaller objects; or, to put it another way, it is not
    part of a large group of objects in a similar region of space with similar orbits.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, this definition is different to how the word “planet” is normally used. I have
  elaborated more on this problem in the chapter <i>Proposed new definitions</i>, in the Appendix.
</p>

<p>
  <small>* An <b>ellipsoid</b> is a 3-dimensional ellipse. A <b>sphere</b> is a special case of
    ellipsoid with equal height, width and depth, just like a circle is a special case of ellipse
    that has equal height and width. A <b>spheroid</b> is an ellipsoid with two equal dimensions.
    Most planets are <b>oblate spheroids</b> (squashed sphere), rather than <b>prolate spheroids</b>
    (stretched sphere), because centripetal force causes equatorial regions to bulge outwards.
    However, it is possible for an object to be gravitationally rounded and yet not spheroidal, such
    as Haumea.
  </small>
</p>

<h2>Major planet</h2>

<p>It’s helpful to know that the word “planet” is actually shorthand for “<b>major planet</b>”.
  Knowing this clarifies things considerably.</p>

<p>When we say our Solar System has eight planets, we’re talking about major planets. However, the
  word “major” is rarely used any more, which is where the confusion comes in. Thus, when someone
  says that Pluto is a dwarf planet but not a planet, what is actually meant is that Pluto is not a
  major planet. In fact, look up “major planet” on Wikipedia and you’ll be redirected to “planet”.
  The use of the word “planet” instead of “major planet” seems primarily due to simplified education
  about the Solar System. Presumably, teaching children (and by extension, the general population)
  that there are only eight planets is simpler than teaching eight <i>major</i> planets, which would
  then require explaining minor planets. In addition, the new IAU definition is for the term
  “planet”, not “major planet”.</p>

<p>There are two categories of major planets, which are <b>terrestrial planets</b> and <b>giant
  planets</b>. In the Solar System, these are organised rather neatly. We have four each, and they
  are grouped together, with the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) in the Inner
  Solar System, and the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) in the Outer Solar
  System.</p>

<p>The difference between these two types of planet is that the gravity of giant planets is strong
  enough to retain hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and helium (He) gases in their atmospheres. These are
  the most abundant gases in the Universe, and the lightest. Terrestrial planets, which are smaller
  than giant planets, do not have strong enough gravity to hold onto them, and thus they escape to
  space.</p>

<p>Because of how our Solar System is organised, with the major planets being divided into two
  distinct groups by the Asteroid Belt, all terrestrial planets are also <b>inner</b> planets, and
  all giant planets are <b>outer</b> planets. Other star systems are not so neatly organised.</p>

<h2>Minor planet</h2>

<p>As you can probably guess, <b>minor planets</b> are smaller than major planets, and significantly
  more abundant. Pluto <i>was</i> considered a major planet, but has been re-classified as a minor
  planet. Minor planets are defined as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orbits the Sun.</li>
  <li>Bigger than a meteoroid (about 1 metre in diameter; see below).</li>
  <li>Not a major planet, i.e. it is either:
    <ul>
      <li>Not gravitationally rounded; <i>or</i></li>
      <li>Has not cleared its orbital neighbourhood, but is a member of group of objects with
        similar orbits, such as the Asteroid Belt, Kuiper Belt, Scattered Disc, Hills Cloud or Oort
        Cloud.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are two categories of minor planet, namely <b>dwarf planets</b> and <b>small Solar System
  bodies</b> (SSSBs). The difference between these is that dwarf planets are massive enough to have
  become gravitationally rounded. There are five official dwarf planets (Ceres, Pluto, Haumea,
  Makemake and Eris), and hundreds of candidate objects that may become classified as dwarf planets
  when we find out more about them (Quaoar, Sedna, Orcus, Salacia, Ixion and many others). There may
  be 10 dwarf planets, or there may be 10&nbsp;000 — we don’t know yet, although it’s estimated that
  there is at least 200. There are at least billions, and possibly trillions of SSSBs.</p>

<p>Minor planets are also classified according to their orbital characteristics:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Asteroids</b> are minor planets of the Inner Solar System. Only the largest asteroid,
    Ceres, is a dwarf planet; all the others are SSSBs. Asteroids have a semi-major axis (which
    approximately means the average orbital radius) less than Jupiter’s (5.2 AU). The vast majority
    of asteroids are found in the Asteroid Belt, which is the region of space between approximately
    2.1 and 3.3 AU from the Sun. Note that the term “asteroid” is commonly used by the general
    public and science journalism to refer to any SSSB, not only those of the Inner Solar System.
  </li>
  <li><b>Trojans</b> share a planet’s orbit, leading or trailing the planet by 60º (i.e. at the L4
    or L5 Lagrange point — more about this later). Almost all of these are in Jupiter’s orbit; only
    about 23 others are known (Earth has one, Venus has one, Mars has seven, Uranus has one, and
    Neptune has 13).
  </li>
  <li><b>Centaurs</b> are minor planets of the Outer Solar System, and have characteristics of both
    asteroids and <b>comets</b> (see below). They have a semi-major axis between Jupiter’s and
    Neptune’s (i.e. between about 5.2 and 30.1 AU).
  </li>
  <li><b>Trans-Neptunian Objects</b> (TNOs) have a semi-major axis greater than Neptune’s. All dwarf
    planets other than Ceres are TNOs, as are all comets. TNOs are further classified as belonging
    to the Kuiper Belt, Scattered Disc, Hills Cloud, or Oort Cloud.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The IAU Minor Planet Center maintains information on all minor planets, and they allocate every
  minor planet a number. For example, Ceres, the first minor planet ever found, is “1 Ceres”, and
  Pluto is “134340 Pluto”. Pluto’s number is large because it was only recently classified as a
  minor planet, and was assigned the next available number.</p>

<p>Asteroids are also classified according to their spectral characteristics, which give clues to
  their composition. There are numerous types, but the three main ones are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>S-type</b> asteroids are silicaceous (rich in silicon), and are mainly found in the inner
    Asteroid Belt.
  </li>
  <li><b>M-type</b> asteroids are metallic (rich in metals, mostly nickel and iron), and are mainly
    found in the central Asteroid Belt.
  </li>
  <li><b>C-type</b> asteroids are carbonaceous (rich in carbon), and are mainly found in the outer
    Asteroid Belt. They are much darker than S and M-type asteroids.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Comets</b> are a type of TNO with highly elliptical orbits, which bring them from the
  Trans-Neptunian Region in close to the Sun. The solar wind blows material away from the surface of
  a comet, giving it a visible tail called a <i>coma</i>.</p>

<h2>Small stuff</h2>

<p>Minor planets do not include objects smaller than about one meter wide. In order of decreasing
  size, these are categorised as:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Meteoroids,</b> which are between about 1 mm and 1 m in diameter.</li>
  <li><b>Micrometeoroids</b>, which are between about 1 µm and 1 mm in diameter.</li>
  <li><b>Nanometeoroids</b> (also known as <b>cosmic dust</b>), which are smaller than about 1 µm in
    diameter.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note, these are not official definitions, as none such exist for these terms. However, this is
  approximately what is meant.</p>

<h2>Satellite and moon</h2>

<p>Objects that orbit other objects in space are called <b>satellites</b>. <b>Artificial
  satellites</b> were made by humans; <b>natural satellites</b> were formed by natural processes.
  Natural satellites of stars are either major or minor planets, or they could even be another star.
  Natural satellites of planets are called <b>moons</b>.</p>

<h2>Satellite planet and satellite planetoid</h2>

<p>There are 19 moons in our Solar System massive enough to have become rounded. While there’s no
  official term for these objects, it’s often useful to distinguish these from smaller, lumpy moons,
  so a name for them is useful. The respected planetary scientist Dr Alan Stern (principal
  investigator for New Horizon, the first spacecraft to visit Pluto) has proposed the term “<b>satellite
    planet</b>” for these objects, which, in my opinion, is perfectly excellent.</p>

<p>The satellite planets of our Solar System are thus:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orbiting Earth: <b>Luna</b></li>
  <li>Orbiting Jupiter: <b>Io</b>, <b>Europa</b>, <b>Ganymede</b> and <b>Callisto</b></li>
  <li>Orbiting Saturn: <b>Mimas</b>, <b>Enceladus</b>, <b>Tethys</b>, <b>Dione</b>, <b>Rhea</b>, <b>Titan</b>
    and <b>Iapetus</b></li>
  <li>Orbiting Uranus: <b>Miranda</b>, <b>Ariel</b>, <b>Umbriel</b>, <b>Titania</b> and
    <b>Oberon</b></li>
  <li>Orbiting Neptune: <b>Triton</b></li>
  <li>Orbiting Pluto: <b>Charon</b></li>
</ol>

<p>Paralleling this definition, I offer the term “<b>satellite planetoid</b>” for smaller moons.
  (This parallels my preference for the term “<b>planetoid</b>” instead of “small Solar System
  bodies”.) Phobos and Deimos are therefore satellite planetoids. More about this in the appendix
  chapter <i>Proposed better definitions</i>.</p>

<h2>World</h2>

<p>As will be discussed in the next chapter, the types of celestial bodies we may be most likely to
  settle will be rounded bodies with solid surfaces, i.e. the objects in our Solar System that are
  massive enough to be gravitationally rounded, but not massive enough to retain an atmosphere
  comprising predominantly hydrogen and helium.</p>

<p>In our Solar System, this includes <i>terrestrial planets</i>, <i>dwarf planets</i> and <i>satellite
  planets</i>. In the absence of an existing term for this set of objects, I’ve opted to call them “<b>worlds</b>”.
</p>

<p>The gravity of worlds is not too low, and not too high, but just right. There are at least 28 in
  the Solar System, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Four terrestrial planets</li>
  <li>19 satellite planets</li>
  <li>At least five dwarf planets</li>
</ul>

<p>This total will increase as more dwarf planets are confirmed.</p>
