<p>This is another difference between the Utopian and Darian Calendars.</p>

<p>The names for the sols of the week in the Darian Calendar parallels the Latin names for the days
  of the week (see the table below). My approach was to research how the days of the weeks got their
  names, and take a similar approach for Mars.</p>

<p>In many Terran languages the days of the week are named for the 7 celestial objects that are
  visible with the naked eye, and that move across the sky against the backdrop of fixed stars.
  Thus, they are named for the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. (Actually, the
  asteroid Vesta is also occasionally visible to the naked eye, as its surface is highly reflective.
  Vesta is the only asteroid visible to the naked eye, however, only very dimly, and it may not have
  been well-known to ancient astronomers.)</p>

<p>From Mars, there are at least 11 objects that fit this requirement: the Sun, Phobos, Deimos,
  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Luna, Jupiter, Saturn, Ceres, Vesta, and possibly other asteroids. If we
  exclude asteroids, moons of other planets, and Saturn, being the farthest away of the remainder,
  we are left with Sun, Phobos, Deimos, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Jupiter.</p>

<p>From these I created good-sounding names using a “sol” suffix in the same way that English names
  for the days of the week use a “day” suffix. The names are ordered such that they match the names
  of days of the week on Earth, in terms of the celestial objects they are assigned to, with 3
  exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Earth, the second day of the week is named for Luna. To parallel this, the second sol of
    the Martian week is instead named for Phobos, Mars’ largest and closest moon. In an earlier
    version of the Darian Calendar, this sol was named “Sol Phobotis”.
  </li>
  <li>On Earth, the third day of the week is named for Mars. On Mars, the third sol of the week is
    named for Earth, to reflect this. This sol was originally named “Sol Terrae” in the Darian
    Calendar.
  </li>
  <li>On Earth, the last day of the week is named for Saturn. On Mars, the last sol of the week is
    instead named for Deimos, Mars’ smaller and more distant moon. From the perspective of Mars,
    Deimos is more visible and important than Saturn.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the English names for the days of the week use Norse equivalents of the planetary gods.
  Tiw = Mars, Woden = Mercury, Thor = Jupiter, and Freya = Venus.</p>

<h3>Alternate names</h3>

<p>When I was developing this calendar, I wanted to represent both the Martian moons in the sols of
  the week in the same way that Luna is represented in the days of the week on Earth (Monday, Lunes,
  etc.). However, I did not like having sols called “Phobosol” and “Deimosol”. The words “phobos”
  and “deimos” mean “fear” and “terror”, which means these names could be translated as “fear day”
  and “terror day”. This is the etymology of the word “phobia”, which gives us words like
  agoraphobia, arachnophobia, etc.</p>

<p>It was for the same reason Tom that changed “Sol Phobotis” to “Sol Lunae” when developing the
  Darian Calendar.</p>

<p>I considered following the example of the Darian Calendar and naming two sols for Luna and
  Saturn, i.e. “Lunasol” and “Saturnsol”, which are perfectly good names, but then there would not
  be any sols named for the Martian moons, which are arguably the second and third most important
  astronomical objects in the Martian sky after the Sun. On the other hand, since they are not large
  enough to be gravitationally-rounded, it could perhaps be argued that they aren't important enough
  to be represented in the sol names.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I decided to attempt to address the root problem of what I believe to be the
  bad names for the Martian moons. After some research, I found two much better names for the moons
  among the Roman pantheon, i.e. “<b>Nerio</b>” and “<b>Liber</b>”. You can read more about this in
  here: <a href="https://shaunmoss.blog/2016/12/21/renaming-the-martian-moons/" target="_blank">Renaming
    the Martian Moons</a>.</p>

<p>Both Nerio and Liber have a strong association with Mars. Nerio, a warrior goddess, was Mars’
  wife, also known as “the strong one”. Mars was originally the god of agriculture and springtime,
  but when he became the god of war, Liber took over his duties as the agricultural god. Liber was
  known as “the free one”. Serendipitously, neither of these names have been assigned to minor
  planets. How much better to have strength and freedom represented in the Martian skies than fear
  and terror! These new names for the moons produce the names “Neriosol” and “Libersol” for the
  Martian Monday and Saturday. These are my preferred names, and I particularly like how the first
  sol of the working week, “Neriosol”, can be translated as “strong sol”, and the last sol of the
  week, “Libersol”, can be translated as “free sol”.</p>

<p>If people don’t accept the new names for the Martian moons, then the names “Lunasol” and
  “Saturnsol” (or “Satursol”) are probably better than “Phobosol” and “Deimosol”.</p>

<p>Some other names I considered, and which have appeared in earlier iterations of the calendar,
  include “Heliosol” instead of “Sunsol”, “Terrasol” instead of “Earthsol”, and “Jovisol” instead of
  “Jupitersol”.</p>
