<p><i>(or: when was mir 0?)</i></p>

<p>Mirs are numbered using integers, i.e. &hellip; &ndash;3, &ndash;2, &ndash;1, 0, 1, 2, 3 &hellip;,
  with mir 0 commencing at the Martian northern hemisphere vernal equinox that occurred on <b>11
    March 1609, 18:40 UTC</b>. </p>

<p>This marks the approximate beginning of what is known as the <b>Telescopic Epoch</b>. Using this
  epoch for the calendar was first suggested in 1999 by Peter Kokh, who was the President of the
  Moon Society, and editor and writer for the <i>Moon Miner’s Manifesto</i> for many years.</p>

<p>The year 1609 represented a new beginning in the relationship between humans and Mars. It was
  when Galileo first started using the newly-invented telescope to observe Mars, and other planets
  and moons. It was also when Johannes Kepler used Tycho Brahe’s observations of Mars to determine
  his laws of planetary motion.</p>

<p>Before mir 0 (i.e. in negative mirs), Mars had only ever been viewed with the naked eye.
  Selecting the Telescopic Epoch for mir numbering means that all dates of telescopic observations
  of Mars, as well as missions, can be expressed with positive mir numbers.</p>

<p>This date of <b>10 March 1609, 18:00 UTC</b> is just 10 days earlier than the Terran northern
  vernal equinox of <b>20 March 1609, 13:20 UTC</b>, which I selected as the epoch for my Earthian
  Calendar. There was also a new moon that occurred just a few days earlier, on <b>6 March 1609,
    03:03 UTC</b>, which I selected as the epoch for my Lunan Calendar. In this way, the epochs of
  the three calendars very nearly coincide.</p>
