<p>If we commit to powering our settlements with renewables, as we should, then energy storage will
  be a requirement. There are several options.</p>

<p>On Luna, we will require enough storage capacity to sustain the settlement during the longest
  periods of darkness, which is about two weeks, even at most PELs. This requirement can be reduced
  by placing the solar cells on towers (see <a class="internal"
    href="http://multiplanetary.com/isru/energy/luna">Energy on Luna</a>).</p>

<p>On Mars, we will require enough storage capacity to sustain the settlement during periods when
  both solar and wind power production are low. If wind power can make up for reduced solar power
  during dust storms, as hoped, then the only time when total power production from both solar and
  wind will be very low will be during windless nights. If so, energy storage capacity only needs to
  be enough for about 12 hours or so. However, it would naturally be prudent to build an energy
  storage system capable of supporting the settlement for much longer periods, in case of variable
  wind speeds, hardware degradation or failures, and so on (see <a class="internal"
    href="/isru/energy/mars">Energy on Mars</a>).</p>

<p>Until the energy system at a settlement is robust and capable of producing abundant power, during
  nighttime periods, on both Luna and Mars, and during Martian dust storms, settlements should
  switch to low power mode. This may include eliminating any unnecessary lighting, heating, air
  conditioning, refrigeration, communications, industrial machinery, battery recharging (mobile
  devices, spacesuits, vehicles, etc.), and so on.</p>

<p>As each settlement expands, its energy requirement will similarly increase, which will in turn
  increase the required energy storage capacity. To control costs, energy storage hardware such as
  batteries will ideally be fabricated from local resources.</p>

<h2>Batteries</h2>

<h3>Flow batteries</h3>

<p>Probably the best kind of battery to use for energy storage on Luna and Mars is a <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery" target="_blank">flow battery</a> (also known as
  a <em>redox flow battery</em> or RFB), as they offer numerous advantages.</p>

<p>In a flow battery, the</p>

<p>Another option could be off-the-shelf industrial batteries such as <a
  href="https://www.tesla.com/powerpack" target="_blank">Tesla Powerpacks</a> as an initial solution
  to energy storage.</p>

<p>This is likely to be a significant capacity, potentially in excess of what can reasonably be
  achieved with batteries from Earth, and the requirement will increase as the settlement expands.
  This places pressure on us to develop alternative solutions, such as constructing batteries
  on-site, or utilising generators or fuel cells.</p>

<h3>Edison cells</h3>

<p>Dave Dietzler of the Moon Society and Peter J. Schubert of Packer Engineering published a paper
  in 2010 titled "Electrical Energy Storage Using Only Lunar Materials", which describes how it
  would be possible to manufacture iron-nickel alkaline batteries, also known as Edison cells, from
  lunar materials. While not the most efficient form of battery, the value of being able to
  construct them from lunar materials, and the necessity for energy storage, makes them a good
  solution.</p>

<p>Thus, as early as is practical, we will construct a factory at Serenity to produce iron-nickel
  alkaline batteries from local materials. Again, these batteries will not only be for Serenity, but
  could also be sold to other businesses in the process of establishing themselves on Luna, forming
  a supplementary income stream.</p>

<h2>Fuel cells</h2>

<p>One of the economic outputs of Serenity will be LOX/H2 propellant, for utilisation by spaceships
  returning to Earth, or on their way to Mars. In addition, this propellant could also serve as a
  source of energy to power the settlement, if required, simply by reacting the LOX and LH2 in a
  hydrogen fuel cell.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, hydrogen fuel cell technology is receiving significant investment,
  particularly from car manufacturers. Thus, lightweight, high performance hydrogen fuel cells will
  be available for use at Serenity.</p>
