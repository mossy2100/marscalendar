<p>Why are we particularly interested in space <i>settlement</i>, rather than simple space <i>exploration</i>,
  or even just the development of a space industry? Why do we need to actually live there? There are
  several important benefits:</p>

<h2>Greater unity on Earth</h2>

<p>Viewing Earth from space results in something called the “Overview Effect” (see the book by Frank
  White, who coined this term). This is a realisation that Earth is a single, whole, living being,
  and that national borders and other divisions between people do not exist in reality. Many of our
  cultural and societal ideas are based on a belief in separation, particularly between people of
  different nations (or races, religions, etc.), and between people and the planet. These
  separations aren’t real, and when seeing the Earth from space, this truth becomes apparent. All of
  us are part of Earth, which is a vast living system. The more people that view Earth from space
  and experience the Overview Effect, the more that the illusion of national borders, and the
  illusion that humans are separate from the biosphere, will dissolve. Not only will this increase
  the number of people who consider themselves citizens of Earth rather than their particular
  nation, it will hopefully also result in greater care for the environment, of which humans are an
  integral part.</p>

<p>Colonising other worlds will also tend to erode the differences between the peoples of Earth as
  our internal model of humanity reorganises itself around worlds and regions of space, rather than
  nations or continents. The concept of “Terrans” will emerge, as distinct from Lunans, Martians,
  and so on, because this is how people living in space will come to perceive those on the home
  planet. This planetary-level identity will also tend to unify the people of Earth. Worldwide
  unification is happening anyway, due to the internet and other factors, however, people still tend
  to identify with their country rather than their planet. But as space settlement builds the idea
  that people of Earth are Terrans, rather then citizens of nations, the Terrans themselves will
  gradually absorb this concept also, and the result should be increased international cooperation
  and peace.</p>

<h2>Confidence</h2>

<p>It will give us confidence as a species. The Apollo mission gave humanity incredible confidence.
  There was a saying at the time: “If we can go to the Moon, we can do anything!”. Well, if we can
  live in space, or on Mars, we can do anything! We will start to see ourselves as an advanced,
  space-faring species capable of achieving great things. When people are living in space, no-one
  will say that we cannot feed the world, clean the oceans and the atmosphere, or create world
  peace. We will just point to our cities in orbit, or on Luna and Mars, and say: “Just look what we
  can do! We can do anything!”</p>

<h2>A new frontier</h2>

<p>Space exploration and industry will open the final frontier, but space settlement will claim it
  for our own. A physical frontier is arguably essential for human evolution, due to its powerful
  effect of stimulating great creativity and innovation. The frontier breaks us out of established
  living patterns. Comfort and safety have their virtues, to be sure, but too much can be dangerous;
  they can lead to sloth, decay, and softness, as opposed to energy, growth, and fitness.</p>

<p>It will be much more of a challenge to live on Luna or Mars permanently than it will be to simply
  visit, because the need for ongoing supply and maintenance of settlements will require significant
  local agricultural, mining, manufacturing, and other capabilities. Settlement entails much bigger
  challenges than simple exploration, and will require bigger thinking and better planning. It will
  mobilise capital and human resources to a much larger degree, and will require significant
  innovation. The process of settling Luna, Mars, and elsewhere in space will push humanity to
  higher levels of achievement than we ever dreamed possible.</p>

<p>The frontier also advances and develops the higher spiritual functions of the human mind, not
  only stimulating new technological ideas, but also philosophical ones. It may be that our
  external, physical frontier parallels our internal, spiritual frontier, and that expansion into
  the physical Universe is necessary for ongoing expansion of our consciousness, capacity for
  wisdom, and civilisation. The frontier forces us to rethink the established patterns of our
  culture in the context of new environments and new technologies, producing a new society which is
  at least partially legacy-free. It encourages re-invention, not only of physical systems, but of
  psychological, social, political, and economic ones. The space frontier will afford us the
  opportunity to keep and foster the good aspects of ourselves, and leave the bad ones behind.</p>

<h2>More science</h2>

<p>Living in space will give us much more scientific knowledge than can be gained from simply
  visiting. The more time we spend somewhere the more we learn about it, and this is as true in
  space as anywhere else. If we really want to understand Luna, Mars, and other worlds, we need to
  be there, on the ground, experiencing their unique cycles, climate, rocks, dust, winds, water,
  skies, etc., and their relationships with the Sun, other planets and moons, and the stars. We need
  to make these worlds our homes and let them become part of us, as we become part of them, to
  really know them and to allow these unique environments to fully stimulate and facilitate our
  evolution. Over time they will unlock more and more of their mysteries, and this increased
  scientific understanding will open up even more new worlds for human settlement.</p>

<h2>More technology</h2>

<p>The frontier, and the freedom and incentive to invent new things from available resources, has
  always produced new technologies. We only have to look at the history of the frontier in America,
  Australia, and many other regions of Earth for evidence. Expand into new environments always
  involves challenges, yet the resources available to meet these challenges may be scarce,
  different, or unfamiliar. However, if the desire to expand (or, indeed, survive) is powerful
  enough, then solutions will be found. Such situations bring out the best in human creativity, and
  is what drives innovation.</p>

<p>It’s much harder to reside permanently at an address in space than to merely explore it. The
  process of learning how to live on Luna and Mars, and the development of the space economy, will
  produce tremendous innovation. For example, we will develop robots and telerobotics for tunnelling
  into rock and carving out habitable volumes; efficient and inexpensive solar and geothermal energy
  technologies; compact food production systems; advanced water recycling and purification systems;
  super-intelligent computers, vehicles and robots; nanotechnologies for metallurgy, manufacturing,
  and recycling; high-speed space transportation; low-latency, high-bandwidth space communications
  systems; artificial gravity; and many other new and wonderful technologies, that will take
  humanity to new levels of achievement.</p>

<p>Right now, on Earth, we are observing exponential advancements in technological development for
  reasons that include evolution of the internet, emergence of a common language, crowd-funding, and
  an abundance of venture capital. This trend will only continue as we expand into space, and the
  unique challenges of space development trigger a cascade of new inventions.</p>

<p>Many new technologies that are being developed now, and that will be developed as we learn how to
  live in free space* and on Luna and Mars, will find applications on Earth and elsewhere as we
  expand to new places in the Solar System.</p>

<p>* The expressions “free space” or “the free space between worlds”, as used in the space
  community, refer to locations not on the surfaces of planets or moons. It thus refers to
  microgravity locations, such as orbits and Lagrange points.</p>

<h2>More environmental benefits</h2>

<p>Space colonisation will help to create a cleaner, healthier Earth. Living in space requires
  in-situ production of energy, water, air, food, and materials; efficient recycling and waste
  management; environment control and life support; mining and manufacturing; advanced robotics and
  telerobotics; and much more. These same technologies, applied on Earth, will reduce waste and
  pollution, increase abundance and health, enable people to live in new regions, while improving
  living conditions in many existing regions and reducing our environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Space habitat design produces insight into air and water recycling, food production, waste
  management, mass and volume optimisation, and more. We know the lower limits on how much volume
  and energy people really require to live, and it’s <i>much</i> less than what we habitually use on
  Earth (especially in western countries). This information suggests multiple opportunities for more
  efficient use of land, water, energy, and other resources on Earth, and thus for reducing our
  environmental footprint.</p>

<p>Learning how to live in space will teach us how to live, affordably and safely, in more exotic
  niches of Earth; in particular, underground. This will reduce the need to destroy Earth’s
  biosphere to make space for human settlements.</p>

<p>Food systems developed for space will be high-tech, potentially modular, and capable of producing
  a healthy, nutritionally-complete diet. This technology can be used on Earth to feed people while
  simultaneously reducing land requirements for agriculture. In fact, it should be possible to
  reduce the amount of land and fresh water we currently use for food production even as Earth’s
  population grows.</p>

<h2>Backing up life</h2>

<p>Human settlement of Luna, Mars, and other worlds can help to ensure the long-term survival of
  numerous Terran species who are at risk of extinction due to climate change, habitat destruction,
  pollution, war, disease, or asteroid impact.</p>

<p>Right now we are losing countless species across the planet due to climate change and habitat
  destruction. Our current accelerated rate of species loss has been called the “sixth mass
  extinction”. While space settlement cannot happen quickly enough to be a solution to this current
  problem, having species spread across two or more worlds will help to prevent extinctions in the
  future.</p>

<p>Settlement of Mars is particularly worthwhile, because Mars may have the potential to be
  terraformed such that it can support Terran organisms. This would enable the engineering of a new,
  second biosphere, hosting millions of species.</p>
