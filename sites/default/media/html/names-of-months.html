<p>The names of the months in the Utopian Calendar is one of the only ways that it differs from the
  Darian Calendar.</p>

<p>When I was designing the calendar, I liked Tom’s idea of using constellations, and of using
  western and eastern names in order to provide cultural balance. The names he uses are good, but I
  felt that this approach didn’t really solve the issue of cultural bias effectively. Chinese
  astronomical tradition, for instance, isn’t represented in this scheme.</p>

<p>I felt that, since this is a modern scientific calendar, the modern scientific names of the
  constellations should be used. However, because there are only 13 zodiacal constellations and the
  calendar requires 24 month names, I decided that the names of any of the 88 modern constellations
  could be used. Instead of the 12 Sanskrit constellations used in the Darian Calendar, I looked for
  12 others. First, I added Ophiuchus, the 13<sup>th</sup> zodiacal constellation. Then I discovered
  that there are 11 constellations with stars brighter than the brightest star in the zodiacal
  constellations (Aldebaran, in Taurus). This made a total of 24 names, which fit perfectly.</p>

<p>These names appeared in an earlier version of this calendar, called the Kepler Calendar, which I
  published in the year 2000, and they are still being used by some websites and apps. However, they
  are not the names presented here. When I reviewed the calendar recently, I wasn’t happy with these
  month names, as some of these were really boring constellations. Also, it seemed to be a problem
  to have months with two-word names like “Canis Major” and “Canis Minor”.</p>

<p>Inspired by the 12 animal signs used in Chinese astrology (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake,
  horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig), I reviewed the list of 88 constellation names and
  selected 24 constellations that represent animals or mythical beasts. To shorten the list, I
  excluded the zodiacal constellations (which I use in the Lunan Calendar), constellations with
  two-word names, and any that represent people or objects.</p>

<p>The result is that each month not only has its own constellation, but also its own animal sign.
  Animal symbolism has played a part in Terran cultures throughout time, and continues to do so
  today, in logos, sports teams, and many other contexts. It’s my opinion that, while this is
  perhaps a less scientific approach, it’s more creative, fun, and colourful. Surely, this is at
  least part of the reason why so many people have an interest in their astrological and Chinese
  signs, despite there being no scientific basis for the characteristics ascribed to them. I also
  believe that this naming system will introduce people to many constellations other than those of
  the traditional zodiac.</p>

<p>Note, the names of months and sols of the week are not the important part of the calendar; the
  mathematics is. Some Martians may use the names from the Darian Calendar, some may use these
  names, some may make up new ones.</p>

<p>The names have been ordered by right ascension of the constellations. It is apt that the mir, and
  thus the northern spring, begin with the month of <i>Phoenix</i>, a creature that symbolises
  cyclical rebirth.</p>

<p>The standard IAU three-letter abbreviation for each constellation is used as the abbreviation for
  each month name. Although these abbreviations often match the first three letters of the name,
  like month abbreviations in the Gregorian Calendar, there are a few exceptions.</p>
