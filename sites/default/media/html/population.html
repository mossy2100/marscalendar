<p>While all the reasons in favour of space settlement listed in the previous chapter are
  exceptionally valid, there’s one which, in my opinion, supersedes them all: <i>colonising space
    will give us a way to sustainably, ethically, and intelligently manage the ongoing growth of the
    human population.</i></p>

<p>Space settlement will give us access to essentially infinite land and resources, including all
  the energy and materials necessary for life and technological civilisation. Once we’ve learned how
  to protect ourselves against the space environment, effectively utilise multiple renewable energy
  sources, efficiently transport materials to and from space, mine asteroids, produce abundant air,
  water and food in space, and other necessary survival skills, we will have the ability to create
  ample habitable volume into which humanity can continue to grow more-or-less <i>ad infinitum</i>.
</p>

<p>In this section we look at why intelligent management of the growing human population is one of
  the most important reasons why we should expand into space, and also (while we’re on the subject)
  how population policies should be applied to space settlements.</p>

<h2>Population management on Earth</h2>

<p>Humans are living longer than ever. In some countries, the average life expectancy will soon
  exceed a century, and many people will have the option to live much longer. As our population
  continues to increase we must learn how to use resources more efficiently on Earth, but without
  space settlement we will eventually run into limits anyway, irrespective of how efficient we
  become.</p>

<p>At any one time, Earth is able to sustainably support a maximum number of people. As our
  technology improves, especially geothermal energy technology, which will enable the construction
  of huge underground cities, large-scale underground food production, large-scale desalination
  projects, and large-scale pollution cleanup, this number will increase. However, it cannot
  increase indefinitely.</p>

<p>The unfettered expansion of the population of humans and livestock across Earth’s surface is
  displacing a growing percentage of the millions of species on which we depend for ecological
  services. We need to calculate the carrying capacity of Earth and define a global population
  limit. This limit will grow over time as we become more efficient at resource utilisation through
  technology, and as we create more habitable volume underground and elsewhere. However, it cannot
  grow <i>ad infinitum</i> if we are confined only to Earth.</p>

<p>Our population is guaranteed to grow. Like most successful species, through the iterative
  refinement of evolution we are genetically programmed at a deep level to do two specific things
  exceptionally well:</p>

<ol>
  <li>procreate</li>
  <li>survive</li>
</ol>

<p>Birth rates worldwide are declining. This trend will most likely continue as developing economies
  catch up. Countries with superior healthcare, education, and, most importantly, gender equality,
  have lower birth rates for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Gender equality is the critical factor. There is a direct correlation between years of education
  among females and birth rates. When females can obtain quality education, and fulfilling,
  remunerative work, there is less pressure within families to produce income-earning males (because
  females can earn, too); reduced assumption that the only purpose of women is to bear children; and
  more women focused on developing their career instead of motherhood.</p>

<p>Also, in less developed countries where the average lifespan is shorter and there is no social
  security, birth rates tend to be higher because death rates are higher, and larger families tend
  to be more capable of supporting their elders. Thus, increasing lifespan through measures such as
  improved food security and water quality, and eliminating disease, also has the effect of reducing
  birth rates.</p>

<p>Death rates globally are declining. This is attributable to improvements in medical technology
  and services; improved nutrition; reduction in warfare, poverty, famine, and disease; longevity
  research; and the use of robots to perform dangerous work. The fact that ageing can be cured is
  now being taken seriously by several new companies and non-profits dedicated to this goal, such as
  Human Longevity Inc., Calico, Methuselah Foundation, and others. Some people alive today may have
  the option to live forever, or at least as long as they choose.</p>

<p>The net population growth rate is simply the birth rate minus the death rate. However, even with
  both of these decreasing, the net population growth rate will always remain positive. Why? Because
  our species has a much stronger biological imperative to reduce death rates than it does to reduce
  birth rates. Making babies and raising children is fun, but dying is not fun. What this means is,
  no matter what we do, our natural inclination as a species will be to grow.</p>

<p>Our strong survival mechanisms and familial protectiveness tend to push death rates towards zero.
  They won’t ever actually reach zero, because there will always be people who like to jump out of
  perfectly good aeroplanes for fun. However, our natural biological tendency will force it as close
  to zero as possible.</p>

<p>On the other side of the equation, birth rates will always remain greater than zero, because we
  are genetically hard-coded to procreate. Even the most career-minded people will often encounter a
  deep inner need to produce offspring and pass on their genetic and memetic information. There is
  simply not the same powerful biological imperative to push birth rates to zero, and they tend to
  stabilise at approximately replacement rates, with each person creating about one new person on
  average.</p>

<p>Another consideration is that as robots and AI free us from work, more people will have time to
  be parents. Therefore, birth rates may begin to again <i>increase</i> in countries that develop a
  high level of automation.</p>

<p>The future growth rate of the human population is hard to predict, but assuming that people
  continue to enjoy making babies and not dying, it is certain to continue growing. However, if we
  do not expand into space, we will eventually run into limits on this growth. Reaching this limit
  will cause conflict, trauma, and suffering, as we compete for resources and the biosphere is
  displaced. Even if it was possible to convert the entire mass of Earth into humans, there would
  still be an eventual limit.</p>

<p>Today we can observe some of the effects of unrestricted population growth, including decimation
  of the biosphere, widespread pollution, overfished oceans, climate change, geopolitical conflict,
  and national and personal policies of selfishness, prejudice, and greed. It seems likely that our
  population will peak and then decrease, as nature pushes back on us with storms and so on. This
  will not only be traumatic for humanity, but also most other species on the planet. While we
  remain restricted to a single planet, either this will happen repeatedly, or we will have to
  implement some measure of population management.</p>

<p>An organised, global system of population control would probably require world government or
  authority of some kind, and would take the form of laws, regulations, and policies for limiting
  birth rates. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying for birth licenses</li>
  <li>policing of unauthorised pregnancies and births</li>
</ul>

<p>Any methods of implementing and enforcing such a system would almost certainly be draconian,
  unpopular, unethical, traumatic to both children and parents, corruptible, and extremely difficult
  to police, especially at a global level. Also, assuming that a birth rate greater than zero is
  preferable to an ageing population, the global death rate would have to match the birth rate in
  order to maintain zero population growth. If the required death rate is not met, then <i>policies
    would also be needed to maintain death rates</i>. What would these policies look like? Who would
  be killed — the old, the sick, the genetically inferior? How would this be determined? How would
  they be killed? Obviously, such a system would be incredibly unethical, antithesis to human
  nature, and open to abuse. Whoever made the rules would almost certainly bias them towards their
  own values and preferences.</p>

<p>Such a system would be far too reminiscent of the Nazi eugenics program, and even in a rational,
  enlightened, scientific, and self-governing society (in fact, self-governance may well be
  incompatible with this kind of system), there would be strong disagreement, and the program would
  surely be unpopular, especially among the poor. As biotechnological services become available that
  enable people to tweak the DNA of their own bodies or those of their unborn children, those who
  can afford genetic-improvement services may be considered more qualified to have children (or to
  live) than those who cannot. Such a system would therefore tend to favour the wealthy, leading to
  a culture of selfishness and greed where accumulation of money is paramount.</p>

<p>We can already get a hint of the effects of this type of attitude and the social problems it
  produces. In countries where quality education and health care are available only to the wealthy,
  a massive disparity between rich and poor, and a value system that considers money as more
  important than life, have developed as people seek to maximise their financial resources at the
  expense of others and of the planet. Although such a system is antisocial, it is viewed as moral
  by individuals within the system because it maximises the survival potential of offspring.
  Extrapolating these kind of social policies, we arrive at a future reminiscent of various science
  fiction dystopias.</p>

<p>Our responsibility and purpose as creative and compassionate beings is to design social and
  economic systems in which health, happiness, pro-social behaviour, self-interest, and morality are
  aligned. The result of this analysis shows that there is exactly one solution to our growing
  population: <b>expand into space</b>. If we don’t, the outcome will be a population graph that
  looks like a stock price, climbing exponentially, peaking, then traumatically crashing, only to
  repeat the cycle continuously until something occurs that reduces humanity to nothing more than a
  curiosity in Earth’s geological record.</p>

<h2>Population management in the Solar System</h2>

<p>With unlimited resources and volume in which to expand, space settlement will free us from this
  ultimate cap on human population. There will still be a limit, but that limit will grow over time,
  indefinitely, as we create new settlements and expand to new worlds and new regions of space.</p>

<p>Space settlement will permit a degree of ongoing population growth <i>without</i> the need for
  periodic traumatic adjustment by the planetary environment, war, or world government population
  control policies. Note, however, that there will still be limits to growth, and there will always
  be. Even if we build 100 settlements on Mars, each with capacity of 100 000 people, that’s still
  only enough room for 10 million extra people; yet Earth’s population currently grows by about 75
  million per year. Expansion into space will not, therefore, suddenly and automatically permit
  unlimited population growth, and we still need to make all those positive and necessary changes
  such as improving healthcare, education, and gender equality worldwide, in order to reduce birth
  rates to a stable minimum. Fortunately, this is already happening in many places.</p>

<p>Expansion into space will, however, makes sustainable population growth possible. It may
  initially be only a small percentage, but this will grow over time as we become better at space
  construction and build increasingly ambitious space colonies and cities. All the resources
  necessary to construct and supply new settlements are available in space in virtually unlimited
  abundance. Therefore, as population growth in the human community creates pressure to construct
  new habitats, we won’t be limited by the resources of Earth, or be pressured to further destroy
  Earth’s unique and precious biosphere. We’ll be able to employ the latest energy, robotics, AI,
  manufacturing, space transportation technologies, and various other technologies, to build space
  habitats for millions of people per year if necessary, and this number will grow exponentially as
  we expand into space and increase our technical capabilities.</p>

<p>Climate change will awaken us to the importance of Earth’s biosphere to our existence in no
  uncertain terms. Unfettered expansion across Earth’s surface will no longer be considered
  intelligent, and as our population surpasses 10 billion we will probably have to go underground
  <b>and</b> into space.</p>

<p>Once the absolute necessity of space settlement for the long term well-being of our species is
  fully understood by the human community as being fundamental to the avoidance of suffering, war,
  and extinction, it may then also become apparent that the most beneficial and important space
  development project we can possibly tackle will be terraforming Mars. This is perhaps the most
  significant reason why the red planet is critical to our future. Terraforming Mars will
  dramatically increase the maximum population that the Solar System can support. As Mars warms, and
  the atmosphere thickens and oxygenates, huge areas of habitable land will open up into which we
  can expand. Clean air, water, and food will be provided by the Martian biosphere much more cheaply
  than was previously possible, and living on Mars will require much less technology. This will
  enable millions, perhaps billions, of people to live on Mars.</p>

<p>Beyond Mars, it seems possible that we will proceed to terraform Venus as well. Although this is
  a much more ambitious project, by that stage we will have a toolkit of planetary engineering
  techniques developed for both Earth and Mars; for, as our planetary engineering technology
  improves, we will also engineer Earth to reverse some of the damage of the industrial era and
  climate change. We can apply our experience on Venus to give us yet another huge area of land into
  which to expand. Beyond Venus, we shall have to look to new worlds in other star systems.</p>

<p>Paraterraforming, in which large enclosed volumes are created (for example, by sealing a lava
  tube, or doming a crater or caldera) and in which biospheres are introduced, is another means by
  which millions more people might be accommodated.</p>

<blockquote><i>We see our civilisation at a crossroads. Down one path is a future of limits to
  growth, environmental degradation, and, ultimately, extinction. Down the other path lies limitless
  growth, an environmentally pristine earth, and an open and free frontier in space.</i> — Rick
  Tumlinson

<h2>Population management in a space settlement</h2>

<p>Availability of rooms, beds, life support resources, and other resources, will define how many
  people that a particular settlement can support at any one time. We will not be able to accept
  more people from Earth if a settlement is already full, because this would produce stress in the
  system. Therefore, it will be essential to know when we <i>are</i> at capacity.</p>

<p>Excessive numbers of children could risk shortages of critical life support resources. We
  therefore need good family planning and birth control technologies. Leaders should communicate
  with the settlers as to when it is safe to introduce new children, and when it isn’t. Ideally, it
  will always be safe for people to have children, because the settlement capacity should outpace
  population growth.</p>

<p>Implementing any sort of system of controlling the number of births within a settlement will be
  very difficult. Unplanned pregnancies are unavoidable, and the settlement authority, which may be
  a private company, cannot force people to have abortions for having unauthorised births.
  Therefore, we must work towards a society that produces sensible birth rates, and ensure there is
  always capacity for new births.</p>

<p>The most humane solution in order for a space settlement to be successful is probably:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that total capacity of the settlement is growing faster than the birth rate. If the
    birth rate is, say, 1% per year, then the capacity must increase by more than 1% per year.
  </li>
  <li>Only allow new immigrants when it will not produce over-capacity. The total population of the
    settlement must be calculated from the current population <i>including</i> all pregnancies, i.e.
    gestating people must be included in the count.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If, for some reason, a settlement cannot expand sufficiently quickly to accommodate all new
  births, then this will have to be communicated to the settlers so they can plan accordingly. They
  will always have the option to emigrate to other settlements, whether on Luna, Mars, or Earth.</p>
