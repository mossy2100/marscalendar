<p>Of the many worlds of the Solar System we might consider colonising, there are numerous
  compelling reasons why Mars is a stand-out champion:</p>

<h2>Proximity</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious advantage. With current chemical rocket technology, only Inner Solar
  System targets can be reached in a reasonable time frame to permit human exploration. It takes
  about six months to travel to Mars, although with additional propellant, and by launching at the
  right time, this could potentially be reduced to four, or even three. By comparison, it has taken
  the Juno mission five <i>years</i> to reach Jupiter, which is the closest of the giant planets.
</p>

<p>Reducing the amount of time spent in space is essential for human missions, for several
  reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The high levels of radiation in the space environment represent a significant health risk. As
    important as this is for astronauts, it is even more important for citizens emigrating to
    off-world colonies, who aren’t trained in the same way astronauts are, nor paid to risk their
    health. Note that this risk becomes less the farther away that spacecraft travel from the Sun,
    which is the primary source of radiation in the Solar System.
  </li>
  <li>Microgravity represents an additional health risk. If a trip must be made in microgravity then
    the less time spent in space the better. Artificial gravity may be an option for some passenger
    flights, but ships with this capability will be larger and require much more propellant,
    resulting in a much more expensive overall mission. The majority of settlers may therefore
    prefer to travel in microgravity purely to save money. If so, a short trip time will be
    important for maintaining their strength.
  </li>
  <li>A shorter trip time reduces the mass of life support consumables, i.e. less food and water
    needs to be carried to support the passengers. This translates to a lighter, smaller, and
    therefore less expensive spacecraft. This is the main reason why sending people to Luna is much
    more affordable than sending people to Mars.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>At its closest approach, Mars is only 36% as far from Earth as the Sun. However, Mars is not
  actually the closest world to Earth. Luna is about 1000 times closer, Venus comes closer to Earth
  than Mars, and it takes less time to reach Mercury than either Venus or Mars. However, Mars is a
  superior settlement target to Luna, Venus, and Mercury in several important ways, as will be
  shown.</p>

<p>With new space propulsion technology, it will take increasingly less time to reach the other
  worlds of our Solar System. But it’s all relative. It will always take much less time to reach
  Mars than most other worlds in the Universe.</p>

<h2>Water</h2>

<p>Mars has plenty of water; more than five million cubic kilometres at or near the surface, and
  potentially much more deeper underground. While this is much less than Earth (with an estimated
  250 million cubic kilometres), it’s still a huge amount. The vast majority of Mars’ water is in
  the form of ice, as permafrost, enormous underground glaciers, and the ice caps. There’s a small
  amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, and more may be in the form of hydrated minerals. Liquid
  water can exist at the surface of Mars for short periods — we’ve observed fresh outflow channels
  on crater walls — and significant quantities may yet be discovered in underground aquifers.</p>

<p>Water is a crucial resource for human settlement of anywhere, which is why most of us live close
  to it. It’s one of the fundamental requirements for our kind of life. On Earth, life is found
  wherever there is liquid water, and almost all life forms can be found living in or near it. Water
  is everywhere in human society, being essential for drinking, cooking, cleaning, gardening,
  agriculture, sewage, many industrial processes, and as a coolant, lubricant, and solvent.</p>

<p>Luna, Venus&nbsp;and Mercury are bone dry in comparison. The only place water of any kind can be
  found on Luna and Mercury is in super-cold, permanently-shadowed regions (PSRs) at the poles.
  Venus is so hot that, long ago, all its water boiled to steam, which was then split into hydrogen
  and oxygen by UV radiation from the Sun; the lightweight hydrogen was blown away by the solar
  wind, and the oxygen bound with metals in the rock.</p>

<p>Many asteroids and moons in our Solar System have plenty of water, and we may settle these
  eventually, but most of these are much farther away than Mars and/or they lack other resources
  needed to build a civilisation.</p>

<h2>Temperature</h2>

<p>The temperature at the surface of Mars is not too extreme, ranging from -140 to 35 °C. The
  average is -63 °C, which is the same as Antarctica. We build bases there, so why not on Mars?</p>

<p>Other worlds in the Solar System are significantly hotter, such as Venus and Mercury, or
  significantly colder, such as Ceres and the outer moons (the warmest is Ceres, with a maximum
  temperature of -38 °C). The temperature on Luna varies between extremes, from -200 to 120 °C.</p>

<p>In extremely hot and cold environments, specialised materials and technology, and lots of energy,
  are required to maintain comfortable internal temperatures of habitats and spacesuits. Because
  Mars’ temperatures are the least different than Earth’s, this problem is easier to solve for Mars
  than any other world in the Solar System.</p>

<p>Mars is just barely warm enough for water to exist in a liquid phase. On the worlds of the Solar
  System other than Earth and Mars, water can only exist at the surface as steam or ice. If the
  atmospheric pressure can somehow be increased, more of the water at the surface of Mars will
  become liquid, potentially forming lakes and rivers. This could make it possible for life to be
  introduced to the surface of Mars.</p>

<h2>Cycles</h2>

<p>Mars has cycles which are very similar to Earth’s. The length of the solar day on Mars (known as
  a “sol”) is just 40 minutes (2%) longer than Earth’s day. This familiar diurnal (day-night) cycle
  will be psychologically beneficial to settlers, and will eliminate the need to create an
  artificial 24-hour diurnal cycle. On Luna, which has a diurnal cycle of 29.5 days, we’ll probably
  want to use artificial lighting to simulate day and night within a settlement. This will require
  energy.</p>

<p>It is known that humans can adapt to this slightly longer day length, although it could be
  difficult. Scientists working on the Mars Exploration Rovers and the Phoenix lander missions lived
  in sync with the Martian diurnal cycle for some time, and they experienced difficulty with
  sleeping and a feeling like constant jet lag. However, this may have been caused by being out of
  sync with Earth’s diurnal cycle&nbsp;and the rest of society, and the biological clocks of
  Martians may adjust to the slightly longer day after living on Mars for a while.</p>

<p>Mars’ axial tilt of 25° is also very nearly the same as Earth’s 23.5°, which gives it a seasonal
  cycle similar to Earth’s. Although each season is, on average, almost twice as long as its Terran
  counterpart, the pattern of summer, autumn, winter, spring is familiar, with a similar degree of
  variation in temperature. Seasons are important for the life cycles of many Terran organisms and
  ecosystems, and are fundamental to several aspects of human civilisation such as agriculture,
  tourism, and sport.</p>

<p>This similarity between the cycles of Earth and Mars should make it easier for humans and other
  Terran species to adapt to the Martian environment, compared with other worlds. Most plants and
  animals have evolved cycles of growth and reproduction in harmony with Earth’s diurnal and
  seasonal cycles. The similar cycles will benefit agriculture in surface greenhouses, and species
  introduced during terraforming.</p>

<p>Earth has cycles that Mars doesn’t, produced by Luna: the 29.5-day cycle of lunar phases, and the
  24.8-hour tidal cycle. These cycles are important for some Terran organisms, particularly aquatic
  species, and it remains to be seen how they will adapt to a planet without a large satellite.</p>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>

<p>Although it may only have a pressure about 0.6% of Earth’s, Mars’ atmosphere alone makes Mars a
  stand-out settlement target, offering numerous important benefits:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s an easily accessible source of useful gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
    and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>).
  </li>
  <li>It acts as an insulating blanket that helps to distribute heat around the planet and stabilise
    surface temperatures. On Mars, as on Earth, wind transports heat from the day side around to the
    night side of the planet, preventing the day side from becoming too hot, and the night side from
    becoming too cold. By contrast, Luna’s lack of atmosphere is why it reaches such extremes of
    temperature.
  </li>
  <li>Air is necessary for sound, one of our most important senses and methods of communication.
    This is important for safety and general environmental awareness, and will enable the use of
    microphones and speakers outside of settlements.
  </li>
  <li>An atmosphere enables cloud formation, and will therefore eventually support a hydrologic
    cycle. This will carry water to higher ground, greatly assisting the spread of life across Mars
    during the terraforming process.
  </li>
  <li>Atmosphere enables aerobraking and aerocapture manoeuvres, which makes faster trips possible,
    and reduces the fuel requirement for spacecraft landings.
  </li>
  <li>It reduces engineering requirements for spacesuits, habitats, and pressurised vehicles, as the
    pressure differential is less.
  </li>
  <li>Erosion by Mars’ wind makes the ubiquitous dust particles smooth and thus far less abrasive
    than they would be in an airless environment. By contrast, lunar dust is very jagged, and thus
    highly sticky and abrasive. This represents a major challenge for machinery, as it can, for
    example, erode wheel bearings quickly.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Mars’ atmosphere is about 96% carbon dioxide with about 2% each of nitrogen and argon, and traces
  of other gases. These gases can be used to make breathable air, hydrocarbons, plastics, carbon
  allotropes, and other materials. Being&nbsp;key plant nutrients, the presence of carbon dioxide
  and nitrogen in the atmosphere will support the introduction of plant life to the surface of Mars.
  Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, also serves to make Mars warmer than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>Many planets and moons have an atmosphere of some kind. However, most are too thick or too thin.
  The giant planets have significant atmospheres composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, and
  although these may represent important resources in the future, these planets aren’t settlement
  targets due to the extreme gravity and lack of a solid surface. Luna, Mercury, Ceres, Io, Europa,
  Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, Dione, Rhea, Triton, Pluto and Eris have extremely thin
  atmospheres. Their density is so low that the molecules don’t behave as a gas, meaning that they
  almost never collide with each other. This kind of atmosphere is called an <i>exosphere</i>, which
  is also the name given to the top-most layer of Earth’s atmosphere. Exospheres are scientifically
  interesting, but nearly useless as a resource.</p>

<p>An important advantage of Mars’&nbsp;atmosphere is that it is transparent.&nbsp;Only four worlds
  in the Solar System have both solid surfaces and gaseous atmospheres: Earth, Mars, Venus and
  Titan. Of these, Earth and Mars are the only two with atmospheres that are transparent. This is an
  oft-overlooked, yet incredibly valuable feature. A transparent atmosphere enables us to see the
  surface of the planet from space, and vice versa, which is important for astronomy, planetary
  observation, navigation, meteorology, solar energy, lighting, photosynthesis, and the
  psychological health and happiness of the inhabitants. This is probably why Mars seems so
  familiar, and is one of the main reasons why Mars is our best choice for making a home.</p>

<p>Finally, Mars’ atmosphere produces a colourful sky. Fine particles of suspended dust give the sky
  a soft apricot colour, with occasional wispy white, yellow, pink or blue clouds. Sunsets are light
  blue, as dust in the air scatters the short-wavelength, high-frequency blue light less than red
  and green. This is an attractive natural feature, which increases the sense of familiarity to
  humans and appeals to our aesthetic instinct.</p>

<h2>Life</h2>

<p>Mars has all the elements necessary for life. The most important of these are commonly referred
  by the acronym <b>CHNOPS</b>, which stands for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carbon (C)</li>
  <li>hydrogen (H)</li>
  <li>nitrogen (N)</li>
  <li>oxygen (O)</li>
  <li>phosphorous (P)</li>
  <li>sulphur (S)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mars has all these in abundance, in addition to all the other various minerals (potassium,
  calcium, etc.) that make up the 14 essential plant nutrients. As discussed, Mars also has plenty
  of water, and everywhere on Earth where we find liquid water, energy, and the necessary elements,
  we find life.</p>

<p>This potential for life means that we’ll be able to grow food on Mars using purely local
  resources. This is a crucial capability. Colonising anywhere in space that does not have the
  ingredients necessary for food production will be challenging and expensive, because either food
  or the necessary ingredients to grow it will have to be imported from somewhere.</p>

<p>With a moderate increase in temperature and atmospheric pressure, it may be possible to introduce
  life to the surface of Mars. This suggests Mars could possibly be terraformed, which is to say,
  engineered to support an uncontained biosphere; a planetary ecosystem, fed by sunlight and rain,
  that can grow and evolve without technological assistance, potentially including millions of
  species. The value of a terraformed Mars would be enormous, as it would greatly reduce the cost of
  living on Mars, as more people could live there without the need for expensive technology, and it
  would provide a home for many Terran and (newly-engineered or evolved) Martian species.</p>

<p>We know of no other world with this&nbsp;kind of potential, and due to Mars’ similarities with
  Earth, we may be able to introduce many Terran species to Mars with little or no genetic
  modification. As one of our primary reasons for space colonisation is to provide alternate homes
  in the Universe for humans and other Terran species, the potential for terraforming vastly
  increases the value of Mars as a settlement target.</p>

<p>Mars may even already support life. On Earth, we find life in the oddest places, including
  extremely dark, salty, sulphurous, acidic, cold, hot, or even radioactive environments. Mars is
  known to have once had oceans, seas and rivers, and thus may have once hosted life. This gives
  Mars major bonus points in terms of scientific value.</p>

<p>The low temperature and pressure at the surface causes water to sublime into vapour almost
  immediately, but conditions below the surface may support liquid water in many areas. It’s
  therefore possible that Mars hosts life even now. In fact, the so-called Allan Hills meteorite
  (also known as ALH84001), which came from Mars, is believed by many scientists to contain
  microfossils. In addition, methane has been detected in the Martian atmosphere, which could be
  coming from a biological source. If there is life on Mars, it's believed that it must be
  underground, due to the radiation at the surface.</p>

<p>Discovery of past or present life on Mars would have enormous implications, suggesting that life
  may be commonplace throughout the Universe rather than scarce. There are a number of satellite
  planets and dwarf planets, including Ceres, Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, Titan, Enceladus, Triton
  and Pluto, that may also have liquid water beneath their surfaces, and thus may host life. All of
  these worlds are interesting targets for space missions to help answer this question.</p>

<h2>Gravity</h2>

<p>Mars’ gravity is almost optimal for supporting surface exploration by humans in spacesuits.
  Because Mars’ gravity is 38% of Earth’s, a 40 kg spacesuit will feel like it weighs only 15 kg on
  Mars, which is a tolerable load for several hours while working outside. In fact, this will be
  good exercise for people exploring or living on Mars. One of the effects of a low gravity
  environment is a reduction in muscle and bone mass, as the body metabolises tissue it doesn’t
  need. In space, the usual approach to mitigating this effect is hours of daily exercise. Working
  outside in a spacesuit on Mars will therefore be very healthful for Mars astronauts and settlers,
  and a much more interesting way to achieve daily exercise requirements than training inside. (Of
  course, permanent settlers with no intention to return to Earth may not care if they adapt to
  Martian gravity.)</p>

<p>Mercury’s gravity is almost exactly the same as Mars’, so it also has this advantage. However,
  consider Venus, where the gravity is 90% of Earth’s. A 40 kg spacesuit would feel like 36 kg on
  Venus, which is much too heavy to work in for long periods. Maybe a soldier could do it, but not a
  scientist. Spacesuits for the surface of Venus will be pressurised exoskeletons.</p>

<p>Because reduced gravity has a deleterious effect on the human body, worlds with higher gravity
  are healthier to explore and settle, particularly if the settlers ever wish to return to Earth.
  After Earth and Venus, Mars has the highest gravity of all the worlds in the Solar System, making
  it the best world to settle based on this factor. This is also one of the reasons why Mercury is
  the next best settlement target.</p>

<p>The reduced gravity of Mars is also an advantage when it comes to building settlements, as they
  won’t need to be as strong. The lack of strong winds is also an advantage in this regard. Larger
  structures can be built with less or cheaper material.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>Mars formed in a similar way to Earth, in a similar region of space, and has a similar geological
  history, including vulcanism and flowing water. Mars is therefore likely to also have rich,
  concentrated deposits of metal ores, in much the same way as Earth does. This implies that
  geological theory utilised on Earth to identify potential ore deposits might also be relevant on
  Mars.</p>

<p>Furthermore, on Mars such deposits can be discovered and accessed more easily than on Earth, due
  to the absence of oceans, trees, animals and cities. The potential wealth of the asteroids is
  important, but advanced, specialised spacecraft and other technologies must be developed before
  these resources can be accessed. In contrast, it may be possible to extract and refine Martian
  metals using conventional and well-understood techniques and technologies.</p>

<p>Mars also has an abundance of easily-accessible carbon: a carbon dioxide atmosphere, enormous
  deposits of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) at the poles, and carbonate minerals in the regolith.
  Carbon is the signature element of organic chemistry, and its availability makes it possible to
  grow food and useful plants such as bamboo and hemp, and to manufacture wood, paper, rope,
  textiles, hydrocarbons, plastics, carbon fibre, carbon allotropes and more, all of which will be
  immensely useful to the Martian settlers.</p>

<p>With an abundance of iron and carbon, steel can be produced on Mars. All the alloying metals used
  in different types of steel are also plentiful. With steel we can make a wide variety of household
  items, tools, machinery and structures. Mars also has an abundance of silicon, the primary
  ingredient in glass, computer chips, solar cells, silicone rubber, and many other materials and
  products.</p>

<p>Mars also has an abundance of thorium, which may supersede uranium as the most important nuclear
  fission fuel in the near future.</p>

<p>Nanotechnology promises to greatly improve the efficiency of ore refining, manufacturing and
  recycling. Nanotechnology combined with 3D printing will make it possible to obtain from Mars all
  the elements needed for advanced technological products such as computers (which contain around 50
  different elements), and to manufacture them efficiently and cheaply.</p>

<p><i>"Mars is the best target for colonization in the solar system because it has by far the
  greatest potential for self-sufficiency.”</i></p>

<p><i>— Dr. Robert Zubrin</i></p>

<h2>Energy</h2>

<p>Mars offers multiple options for energy production.</p>

<p>As one of the Inner Solar System planets, Mars is close enough to the Sun to utilise solar
  energy. The intensity of solar energy at the surface of Mars is only about half that of Earth’s,
  but this is sufficient for photosynthesis and electricity production. Solar power is a proven
  technology on Mars; several rovers and landers have been solar powered.</p>

<p>Mars may even be a perfect candidate for space solar power, since solar-powered satellites would
  be unaffected by dust storms, and (unlike on Earth) there are no physical or political obstacles
  to the construction of rectenna arrays.</p>

<p>If nuclear fission is permitted on Mars, it also has an abundance of nuclear fission fuels such
  as uranium and thorium. In addition, if nuclear fusion becomes viable, one of the most important
  fuels, deuterium, is five times more abundant per hydrogen atom than on Earth.</p>

<p>Mars also offers wind energy. The thin atmosphere could make this an impractical option
  initially, but new types of lightweight turbines, perhaps made from nanostructured materials, may
  yet be developed that can efficiently exploit this energy source. Also, terraforming will thicken
  the atmosphere, which will help make wind power viable.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, Mars shows evidence of recent (geologically speaking) vulcanism, and
  probably has geothermal hotspots. Considering new developments in this field, and the advantages
  geothermal energy has over both solar and nuclear, it may become one of the most important forms
  of energy production for Mars settlements.</p>

<h2>Potential for commerce</h2>

<p>Although Mars has an abundance of valuable natural resources, it seems unlikely that these will
  be a source of income for Mars, since all the same materials can be obtained on Earth without
  expensive interplanetary shipping costs. Mars’ resources will mainly benefit the Martians.
  However, Mars offers other ways to generate income.</p>

<p>For example, Mars may be an ideal location to conduct large-scale refineries and other operations
  that support asteroid mining, being closer to the Asteroid Belt, and having a shallower gravity
  well than Earth. Ore from asteroids could be shipped to Mars for refining or manufacturing
  purposes, before export to Earth or elsewhere in the Solar System.</p>

<p>Mars also has the potential to be a popular tourist destination, offering endless possibilities
  for hiking, climbing, exploration, orienteering, cross-country rover driving, ATVs, regoboarding,
  and other low-g sports. Mars’ abundant natural beauty, moderate gravity, and (hopefully) cultural
  attractions, could make it more appealing than many other space tourism destinations. Initially
  the trip times will be too long for tourists, but as new propulsion methods are developed, and
  trip times are reduced to weeks, then days, more and more people will look to Mars as the ultimate
  adventure holiday destination. Good business opportunities may exist in developing 5-star hotels
  offering breathtaking views and adventure activities, in prime locations such as the summit of
  Olympus Mons or the rim of Valles Marineris.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable Martian exports will be information products, such as content,
  multimedia, software, designs and inventions. As any software or internet entrepreneur knows, the
  primary benefit of information products is that, once produced, they cost nothing to manufacture
  or ship. Humans on Mars will generate countless petabytes of content and data from the very first
  landing, as the activities of astronauts and settlers are streamed back to Earth for the benefit
  of fans, friends and family. Mars will inspire writers, artists, poets, musicians, photographers
  and filmmakers, as new territories always have, and much of this content may find a big&nbsp;audience
  on Earth.</p>

<p>Any frontier, particularly in a new and challenging environment, has the effect of stimulating
  innovation and invention. Many technological products invented on Mars could find markets on Earth
  and elsewhere in the System.</p>

<p>Property development is likely to&nbsp;become the biggest industry&nbsp;on Mars, along with the
  associated construction, infrastructure development, and provision of utilities, facilities and
  services. A lot of people already want to go to Mars, and this number will grow as more and better
  settlements are developed. Opportunities will exist for visionary property developers that can
  offer affordable, comfortable and safe homes on Mars. A growing population on Mars will generate
  countless associated business opportunities in hospitality, retail, sports, entertainment,
  transport, home furnishings, repairs and maintenance, and every other aspect of human society.</p>

<p>In fact, most of the businesses on Mars will cater for customers on Mars. They will provide
  products and services to the people, business, and settlements already on Mars. Many of the
  regular businesses we have on Earth will be developed on Mars in some form or another.</p>

<h2>Moons</h2>

<p>Mars has two natural satellites (Phobos and Deimos, or Nerio and Liber - see later chapter on
  <em>Renaming the Martian Moons</em>), which are tremendously useful assets with the potential for
  a wide range of purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>scientific research</li>
  <li>space stations</li>
  <li>tourist destinations</li>
  <li>way-stations for explorers or travellers</li>
  <li>refuelling or resupply depots for spacecraft</li>
  <li>sources of valuable materials</li>
  <li>factories for space manufacturing</li>
  <li>communications</li>
  <li>planetary observation</li>
</ul>

<p>Planetary satellites represent a source of raw materials in a shallow gravity well, at a useful
  location in orbit. Mars’ moons could become valuable sources of raw materials for space
  engineering and construction; for example, we may build solar-powered satellites using material
  from these moons more cheaply than building them on Mars and launching them to orbit.</p>

<p>The best use for the Martian moons, however, is probably to convert them into space stations for
  science and tourism. A headquarters for the terraforming project could be located on Phobos or
  Deimos, from which vantage point the planetary surface can be continuously monitored in
  detail.</p>

<p>Moons are an enormous asset for any world. Yet another similarity between the red and blue
  planets: Earth and Mars are the only terrestrial planets with moons.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Mars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is one of the closest planets to Earth, and one we can reach, explore and settle using current
    or near-term technology.
  </li>

    System.
  </li>
  <li>Offers numerous commercial opportunities.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although some people favour free space, Luna, Mercury&nbsp;or the asteroids as places where we
  should focus our initial space settlement goals, most agree that Mars is the grand prize. It
  certainly has captured the public imagination. It’s fortunate that a planet with so many
  similarities to Earth, and so many qualities that make it well-suited to exploration and
  settlement, is our neighbour; but, perhaps this is no surprise, since Mars has formed in the same
  region of space, and from the same stuff, as Earth.</p>

<p>It’s easy to focus on the difficulties. Mars is very cold, the air is thin and toxic, the gravity
  is low and the radiation is high. Mars also has the longest synodic period with Earth of any of
  planet in the System, at 780 days, which is 33% longer than for Venus, and double that for
  Jupiter. The synodic period&nbsp;defines how often missions can be sent to the planet, and when
  they can return; thus, missions to Mars must be launched less frequently, and surface missions
  will be longer than for any other planet.</p>

<p>However, the fact remains that Mars is more like Earth than any other world we know of, and will
  be easier to settle than anywhere else. If we’re going to live into space, it’s one of the two
  best places to start (the other being Luna).</p>

<p>The ability for Mars to ultimately become self-sufficient has tremendous implications that could
  benefit all humanity. Most other settlements in the Solar System will need to be supported from
  Earth, and therefore will need to offer considerable value, whether economic, scientific or
  military, to justify the cost of that support. Many bases will be like scientific outposts in
  Antarctica, or remote mining communities. Mars, on the other hand, could become a thriving,
  vibrant, self-sustaining civilisation, with the potential to eventually develop its own culture,
  economic and political systems, and more. Mars represents the possibility to develop new models of
  society and culture, and abandon some of the more negative aspects of Earth culture. The
  experiments that work on Mars may light the way for the advancement of all humanity.</p>

<p>Mars captures our imagination. The beautiful skies, geological formations, views and landscapes,
  make it easier to imagine human settlements on Mars than any other known extraterrestrial world.
  This is why our science fiction literature is replete with stories of mythical Martian
  civilisations. Mars is a blank canvas for anyone with an active imagination.</p>
