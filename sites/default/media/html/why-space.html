<p>The benefits of space research are not universally appreciated or understood. Some feel that it
  diverts resources away from other important problems, or that it doesn’t produce a sufficient
  return on investment. However, a closer look will reveal that everyone benefits from space
  research and development, not just an elite few nor only those nations who conduct missions. And
  we benefit significantly.</p>

<p>The most common argument against space research is that there are more serious problems on Earth
  that we should focus our attention on, such as disease, poverty, inequality, climate change, war,
  and/or other social and environmental problems, before trying to expand into space. While this may
  seem an entirely positive and valid standpoint on the face of it, the fact is that there has <i>always</i>
  been, and always will be, problems on Earth; <i>and</i>, that these problems are being addressed
  and conditions on Earth worldwide are getting better.</p>

<p>If we wait until Earth is “fixed” before going to space, we will never go! There were problems in
  England when Captain Cook departed for the Pacific, yet his voyage of discovery produced increased
  prosperity and scientific understanding, countless innovations, and the discovery of vast and
  beautiful new lands.</p>

<p>The reality is that things have never been better on Earth. We’ve never had less slavery,
  disease, poverty, war, hunger, or homelessness. We’ve never lived longer, had so many tools, or
  been able to connect and communicate with so many others. Life is getting better for people,
  worldwide, all the time. While many people believe the opposite, in my opinion this is at least
  partially because people develop the impression from movies and television that the past was more
  comfortable and safe than it actually was.</p>

<p>The world is improving primarily due to technological innovation. Observing trends in
  technological innovation and social entrepreneurship, we can discern that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Humanity’s problems are being, and will continue to be solved, <i>whether or not we invest
    time and money into space research</i>. Lots of people are working on all kinds of important
    problems, and this won’t suddenly stop when we start building bases on Luna and Mars.
  </li>
  <li>Space research produces <b>significant</b> technological innovation, while also developing
    minds, benefitting national economies, giving us insight into the cosmos and ourselves, and
    improving international relations, all of which add up to <i>making life on Earth a whole lot
      better</i>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not as if hugely significant resources are being diverted into space. The cost of space
  exploration is actually small compared with other categories of government spending. NASA, for
  example, by far the best funded of all space agencies, receives $18 billion per year. This may
  seem a lot, but it is actually less than 0.5% of the US federal budget. Compare this with $600
  billion spent on the military; over 30 times as much. Or, consider the $90 billion spent on
  corporate subsidies annually. Money isn’t being wasted on space. In fact, space, along with
  energy, health, and education, are grossly underfunded by most nations.</p>

<p>When we think the myriad benefits of space research versus the cost, the return on investment is
  colossal compared with other categories of government spending.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why space attracts special criticism is because it garners a lot of media
  attention. This tends to make it a target. Space launches, missions and discoveries are
  spectacular and watched by millions. In comparison, significantly larger areas of government
  expenditure are kept hidden, or are dull in comparison, and attract much less attention. Because
  many people have been led believe that the images and stories on television somehow accurately
  reflect reality, this often leads to a skewed perception.</p>

<p>Interest in exploration, development, and settlement of space is growing quickly, especially
  among students. Humans are explorers by nature, and there will always be those of us who desire to
  see what’s beyond the horizon; those whose souls soar at the idea of a huge amount of open space,
  where they can create something new. There is a magical “frontier” feeling, which some of us
  simply crave — <i>a sense of immense creative freedom and self-determination</i>. There is a
  profound sense of adventure and purpose embedded in the building of something new and timeless,
  like a town on the edge of civilisation, and this is intoxicating to a certain type of people. Why
  struggle to fit into a broken system when you can go to the frontier and help to create better
  systems?</p>

<p>Some humans simply have the ideas of exploration and expansion written in their DNA. We are the
  ones who will go to Luna, Mars, and beyond, and lift our species to a higher plane of existence
  than ever before imagined. From the perspective of space, Earth is a single, whole living planet,
  and the concept of nations appears absurd and obsolete (which it is). That will our be our
  perspective from space, and due to our connection with Terrans, it will also affect how they see
  themselves.</p>

<p>Space is for dreamers and visionaries. We need such people in our society, because they play an
  important role in our evolution as a species. Our imagination pulls us upwards and onwards,
  towards the stars. Technology is advancing extremely rapidly now, and the number of people working
  on space research in both the public and private sectors is growing. It’s just a matter of time
  before we reach Luna, Mars, and worlds beyond.</p>

<p>The primary benefits of space research are covered below.</p>

<h2>Scientific discovery</h2>

<p>Unique scientific insights are gained by studying the space environment and other worlds. Space
  research leads to increased understanding in literally every branch of science, including life
  sciences such as biology and medicine; physical sciences such as physics, astronomy, chemistry and
  planetary science; social sciences such as psychology and political science; and formal sciences
  such as mathematics and computer science.</p>

<p>Everyone on Earth benefits from the advancement of science. The better we understand our
  Universe, the better we can manage the resources available to us, the more empowered we are to
  invent new things which make our lives better, and the better the decisions we can make about how
  to develop our civilisation. Technology is built on scientific understanding. Scientific discovery
  enables improvements in the production of food, water, energy, materials, homes, medicines, and
  every kind of technological product from cars to phones to power plants.</p>

<p>Scientific knowledge is increased by inquiry, investigation and exploration, whether by looking
  into atoms, cells, mineral grains, oceanic depths, or the far reaches of space. We’ve learned much
  about Earth by examining stars, galaxies, other planets, and moons, and we continue to learn more
  every day. The wealth of data collected by planetary spacecraft such as Mars rovers, for example,
  teach us more about planets in general, not only Mars.</p>

<p>Gaining a deep understanding of the Universe gives us the knowledge necessary to secure the
  survival of humanity and many other Terran species, while simultaneously creating many new
  opportunities and challenges for human advancement and evolution. Scientific and engineering
  knowledge is developed by means other than space research, however, space seems to achieve much
  greater results. This is because space represents specific challenges not found in other fields,
  which leads to unique achievements and breakthroughs, and because expansion into space provides
  numerous other benefits important to our future beyond simply knowledge.</p>

<h2>Technological innovation</h2>

<p>Space research has produced innovation in materials, communications, computing, transportation,
  consumer products, and countless other areas. Directly or indirectly, these advancements improve
  everyone’s quality of life.</p>

<p>These new technologies do not only benefit people living and working in space or the space
  industry. Technology developed for space often finds applications on Earth (classic examples being
  the handheld video camera and aerogel). For example, suborbital vehicles developed for space
  tourism will eventually displace airplanes, to a degree, by providing services such as rapid
  transport, package delivery, and resource distribution. Communications technologies developed for
  space will provide everyone on Earth with internet access.</p>

<h2>Inspiration and education</h2>

<p>Space exploration, especially human space flight, is the grand adventure of our time, and
  inspires people, particularly young people still choosing their career paths, to become
  astronauts, scientists, and engineers. People associate space with the future, advanced
  technology, robots, spaceships, and distant, exotic worlds, all of which activate the imagination
  because they are so fantastic. It’s the reason why science fiction exists as a distinct genre, and
  why many bright young people aspire to work in the space program. Science fiction inspires, and is
  inspired by, human activities in space.</p>

<p>Increased enrolment in STEAM courses provides huge benefits to national economies, as many of the
  newly educated find work in science or engineering-related sectors instead of (or in addition to)
  space, such as mining, agriculture, health, communications, IT, biotech, chemicals, construction,
  defence, and others. Those with a more artistic nature have been inspired by space to produce
  enduring literature, music, and art.</p>

<p>Because space research captivates students’ interest, this helps to educate them. Some school
  science teachers pitch their lessons in the context of space, or even teach dedicated space
  science courses, for the simple reason that students perceive space as cool and interesting. This
  helps to engage their attention, enthusiasm, and creativity. Agencies like NASA provide
  educational content and multimedia at no cost, in addition to opportunities for students to engage
  with astronauts and the ISS (International Space Station). College and university students benefit
  from summer programs, internships, and scientific research published by NASA.</p>

<h2>Economic returns</h2>

<p>Space research helps to build up a nation’s intellectual capital, providing valuable experience
  for scientists, engineers, and managers who will often migrate from space agencies to science or
  technology-related industries, academia, or the military. Companies, universities, and governments
  then benefit from their unique experience and knowledge, which has positive effects on the
  economy.</p>

<p>People with a background in space are well-respected in the wider community, and with good
  reason: space presents very difficult problems with little room for error. Space research is not
  only a skill-builder but a confidence-builder, and many ex-space-agency people have gone on to
  create innovative new companies that return a tangible economic benefit.</p>

<p>The new technologies that arise from space research also create economic benefits. Commercial
  applications for products spun off from space research lead to the formation of new companies and
  revenue streams.</p>

<h2>Abundant resources</h2>

<p>Space represents a<b> </b>virtually unlimited supply of valuable resources, including energy,
  metals, carbon, water, hydrocarbons, gases, and minerals, the building blocks of every useful
  resource we consume on Earth. If the burgeoning human population on Earth is consuming too many
  resources for one planet, as numerous experts claim, then space is the answer. Not only can
  resources from space be used on Earth, but also in space by the new communities we create there.
  There are abundant resources for constructing and powering space cities and vehicles, which will
  give rise to a vibrant space economy and civilisation, spanning the Solar System.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Metals, carbon, silicon, water, oxygen, ammonia, and more</b> are available in abundance
    from asteroids<b>.</b> There are literally millions of asteroids in our Solar System, many the
    size of large mountains (some much larger), and composed of valuable materials. Metals, carbon,
    and silicon can be used to build space stations and ships, and water and oxygen can provide them
    with propellant and critical life support resources. Ammonia can be used as fuel, fertiliser, or
    a source of nitrogen for air.
  </li>
  <li><b>Solar energy</b> can be collected in space, where the Sun always shines, and without
    impedance by atmosphere or clouds. Solar powered satellites can be placed in the orbits of
    Earth, Mars, and other worlds, to provide clean energy to settlements on the surface.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Hydrocarbons</b> can be found on worlds such as Titan. On Earth much of our technology is
    still heavily dependent on hydrocarbons, which we mainly utilise for electricity and heat.
    However, even as we transition to sustainable energy, hydrocarbons will remain important for the
    production of plastics, lubricants, and other products, and are a valuable rocket fuel.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Fusion fuels</b> such as deuterium, tritium and helium-3 (see Table 1, below) can be found
    in lunar regolith and Martian ice, and in almost limitless quantities in the atmospheres of the
    giant planets. If fusion ever becomes a viable energy technology, space development will give us
    access to more fuel than we will ever need, and will open up the Outer Solar System for
    settlement.
  </li>
  <li><b>Rare earth elements</b>, required for many modern technological products, can be found in
    concentrated deposits on both Luna and Mars. These elements are difficult to refine with current
    technology, which means concentrated ore deposits are highly valuable.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the above list shows, one of the most important resources that space gives us is energy,
  whether from the Sun, or from chemical or fusion fuels. With abundant energy, we can make
  virtually anything: food, clothing, vehicles, buildings, and technological products of all kinds.
  Having access to the resources of space will enable us to build settlements in space. In this way,
  space settlement is analogous to settlement of the Americas or Australia; on arrival, the settlers
  utilised locally-sourced wood, stone, water, animals, and other resources, to build and supply new
  settlements.</p>

<p>Space development must initially be supported using only Earth’s resources, but once we begin to
  tap into the resources of space, it will become progressively easier to build and do more in
  space. Luna, Mars, and especially the asteroids, all have much shallower gravity wells than Earth,
  which means once we are able, extracting resources from these bodies will be significantly
  cheaper.</p>

<p>Developing the tools to access the limitless resources of space should really be our first
  priority. With this achieved, space provides an abundance of all the resources we need to colonise
  space, and also to solve many problems on Earth.</p>

<p>As our technological capability increases we are able to access resources everywhere more easily
  and cheaply, increasing their supply and reducing cost. However, the exponentially-increasing
  demands of our growing population can sometimes be difficult to meet. Access to the resources of
  space, and progressively improving the efficiency with which we can obtain these resources, will
  eliminate that problem, perhaps forever. This abundance will mean an improved quality of life for
  all people and other creatures on Earth, and everywhere else in the Universe where we may
  spread.</p>

<h2>Asteroid defence</h2>

<p>Space research will help to ensure the survival of the human species, as well as many other
  Terran species, because we will develop the ability to divert PHAs (Potentially Hazardous
  Asteroids) and thus prevent catastrophic impacts. It’s possible that Earth will again be hit by a
  large asteroid, maybe even as large as the one that wiped out almost all life on Earth 66 million
  years ago. While major collisions are infrequent, they happen nonetheless, and the effects can be
  unpleasant. Astronomy improves our ability to detect PHAs, and the development of an asteroid
  mining industry will give us the ability to redirect them.</p>

<p>It’s fortunate that asteroids are highly valuable, because if we aren’t sufficiently motivated by
  the risk of impact to develop the technology to manipulate asteroids, then the potential for vast
  profits should do the trick.</p>

<p>Space settlement will provide an additional layer of protection, because if an asteroid arrives
  which is too large, or moving too quickly for us to divert, and it hits Earth, then the people
  living in space colonies — especially those on Mars, which have the potential to be
  self-sufficient and independent from Earth — may survive even if people on Earth do not. This
  underlines the importance of establishing colonies on Mars as soon as possible.</p>

<blockquote><i>All civilisations become either spacefaring or extinct.</i> — Carl Sagan</blockquote>

<h2>Environmental benefits</h2>

<p>Environmental benefits result from space research and settlement. Earth observation satellites
  provide valuable data about climate, the atmosphere, the biosphere and the oceans, which inform
  scientists and policy-makers about climate change and the environment.</p>

<p>Also, because of the advantages of low-gravity environments, and because there aren’t any trees,
  cities, or oceans in the way, it will be possible to eventually move much of our mining and
  manufacturing operations off Earth and into space, thus reducing ecological destruction and
  pollution.</p>

<h2>Greater world peace</h2>

<p>Much of the geopolitical conflict on Earth is about resources. Access to the infinite resources
  of space will thus eliminate one of our main causes of conflict. If minerals are available in
  virtually limitless quantities from space, there will be much less interest in invading or seeking
  influence over other nations on Earth. This will lead to greater peace and co-operation worldwide,
  with a corresponding reduction in the associated destruction and wastage of both human and
  (ironically) material resources associated with war.</p>

<p>In addition, history has shown that collaboration in space leads to improved international
  relations. Because human spaceflight is expensive and difficult, only a few nations have yet
  attempted it. To achieve more and learn from each other, they are often willing to cooperate and
  share resources and data. In addition to improving the likelihood of success, and more quickly
  developing space technology and scientific understanding, such collaborations naturally also
  improve international relationships. All major space agencies are currently developing plans for
  Mars, and almost all have agreed to work together.</p>

<p>The space-faring nations are the superpowers of the world. The more these nations collaborate,
  the less likely they are to engage in major conflict with each other. One of the great and often
  unsung benefits of space is the way it brings the world together to participate in a grand
  adventure that speaks to all of our souls. I bet you could go to any country in the world and find
  people interested in climbing to the stars and spreading out into the Cosmos.</p>

<p>Mars offers so much excitement, possibility and interesting information, that all the major space
  agencies want to be involved in human missions. The challenge is so great that collaboration
  between them will almost certainly be necessary.</p>

<p>I’m the first to admit to being an idealist. I’m a digital nomad, world citizen, and techno-hippy
  space geek. I genuinely want world peace. I want everyone to be friendly and healthy, and to love
  each other, like a big, happy, global family, and I do believe we will achieve this. I believe
  it’s the duty of all people to work towards a world of friendship, safety, health, wisdom,
  freedom, peace, harmony, and happiness.</p>

<p>In my assessment space settlement is a key requirement for that to happen. Having access to the
  infinite resources of space effectively removes the boundaries on our ecological niche. Combined
  with ongoing technological development, this should, theoretically, eliminate almost all causes of
  conflict among humans. Perhaps there will always be people who desire to dominate others, but most
  people are fundamentally good, and once survival needs are met, they usually play nice. Survival
  stress is the main cause of conflict.</p>

<p>Space settlement represents an open future, in contrast to a closed future in which we do not
  expand beyond Earth, but compete more and more intensely for a dwindling supply of resources. A
  closed future is a world of conflict, competition and war. An open future is one where we expand
  into space and enjoy abundance for all. It’s a future of peace.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we should approach Mars as a unified people. The borders between Terran
  nations have already begun to crumble, thanks to the internet, which is creating an increasing
  degree of connection. Millennials are largely unaware of the national and racial differences that
  were so real and tangible to our the generations of our parents and grandparents. The world is
  changing. A generation from now, settlement of Mars will be underway, the world will be totally
  connected, and most of those old prejudices will be gone.</p>
