<p>Energy&nbsp;is the most fundamental resource necessary for the development of a successful space
  settlement, since everything else depends on it. In the following chapters we will review the
  various approaches to producing electrical energy in space settlements, including utilisation of
  local energy sources, and the pros and cons of each technology.</p>

<p>Energy is needed for the following purposes and more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ECLSS</li>
  <li>Lighting</li>
  <li>Heating</li>
  <li>Refrigeration and cooking</li>
  <li>Communications</li>
  <li>Computing</li>
  <li>Air and water production</li>
  <li>Airlock operation</li>
  <li>Recharging of mobile devices, spacesuit, vehicle, and robot batteries</li>
  <li>Commercial and industrial activities</li>
</ul>

<h2>In situ energy production</h2>

<p>In situ energy production is essential to a lunar or Mars outpost. Energy abundance is essential
  for survival, and a successful, growing, and abundant local economy. Energy will be required by
  all residents, all industrial operations, and all businesses.</p>

<p>Production of abundant energy without reliance on Earth is an important consideration when
  considering long term settlement, as our goal is maximum self-sufficiency. This is especially
  important with respect to energy, for without it, we cannot stay alive, let alone produce anything
  or maintain the settlement. Energy is not easily imported like a physical resource.</p>

<p>Producing energy from renewable sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal, would be considered
  a form of ISRU, as would producing energy using fuel obtained locally, such as methane or
  uranium.</p>

<h2>Fabrication and repair of energy hardware</h2>

<p>Ideally, we will not only produce energy from local resources, but also all, or most, of our
  basic energy hardware, such as solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, fuel cells, and so forth.
  This capability will enable our energy system to scale to a much greater degree, significantly
  lowering costs and improving energy security.</p>

<p>The most important type of energy hardware to learn how to fabricate on both Luna and Mars will
  be solar panels, which represent an comparatively easy, low-tech, and low-maintenance method for
  greatly expanding each settlementâ€™s energy production capacity. We will cover hectares of ground
  with solar panels.</p>

<p>Wind turbines could potentially be fabricated from plastic, steel, or other materials, using 3D
  printing or more conventional (or future) manufacturing processes. Graphene cables for geothermal
  plants on Mars could potentially be fabricated from atmospheric carbon.</p>

<p>It will probably be decades before the lunar or Martian industrial base has the capability to
  manufacture something as complex as a fission or fusion reactor. For this reason and others,
  nuclear technologies are not the best choice for these settlements.</p>

<h2>Renewable and non-renewable energy</h2>

<p>There are two main categories of electricity production methods: <b>renewable</b> and <b>non-renewable</b>.
  Renewable methods either do not require fuel, or consume fuel at a slower or equal rate than the
  rate at which the fuel is replenished by natural processes. Non-renewable methods require some
  form of fuel, which is consumed at a faster rate than it is replenished.</p>

<p>The main types of renewable energy are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solar power (thermal and electrical, surface and space-based)</li>
  <li>Wind power</li>
  <li>Hydropower (tidal, wave, and hydroelectric)</li>
  <li>Geothermal power</li>
</ul>

<p>The main types of non-renewable energy are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas)</li>
  <li>Nuclear fission</li>
  <li>Nuclear fusion</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither hydropower, nor fossil fuels, will be options for Luna or Mars.</p>

<p>The most studied methods for producing electricity in space settlements are solar and nuclear
  fission power. Wind, geothermal, and space-based solar power may also be viable options for
  electricity production on Mars, and are worth examining. However, fusion power may become the
  ultimate game-changer that opens up the Solar System for settlement.</p>

<p>Each of these energy production methods have advantages and disadvantages. In the next chapter we
  will look at why we are probably better off developing power systems based on renewables.</p>
