<p>The names of the months in the Utopian Calendar is one of the only ways that it differs from the
  Darian Calendar.</p>

<p>When I was designing the calendar, I liked Tom’s idea of using constellations, and of using
  western and eastern names in order to provide cultural balance. The names he uses are pretty cool,
  however, I felt that this approach didn’t really solve the issue of cultural bias effectively.
  Chinese astronomical tradition, for instance, isn’t represented in this scheme.</p>

<p>I decided to depart from the zodiacal constellations and embrace any of the 88 modern
  constellations as potential names. I felt that these names were fairly well known worldwide (at
  least by astronomers), and were suitable for a modern scientific calendar. Therefore, instead of
  the 12 Sanskrit constellations, I selected 12 other names from the current 88 constellations.
  First, I added Ophiuchus, the 13<sup>th</sup> zodiacal constellation. Then I discovered that there
  are 11 constellations with stars brighter than the brightest star in any of the zodiacal
  constellations, which fit nicely.</p>

<p>However, these are not the names presented here. The only reason I mention this scheme is because
  those names were the ones I published back in 2000 in the Kepler Calendar, and from there they
  propagated and became utilised in other places, such as the <a
    href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/martian-calendar/id1039724604" target="_blank">Martian
    Calendar app</a> by Laurie Harrison.</p>

<p>When I reviewed the calendar recently, I wasn’t happy with these names, thinking that these were
  really some of the more boring constellation names. Also, it seemed to be a problem to have months
  with two-word names like “Canis Major” and “Canis Minor”. I then reviewed the list of 88
  constellation names and selected 24 constellations that represent animals or mythical creatures,
  avoiding two-word names, and constellations that represented people or things</p>

<p>The result is that each month has its own mascot, a symbolic animal or creature, and people will
  enjoy identifying with the animal or creature associated with the month they are born in. Animal
  symbolism has played a part in many Earth cultures throughout time, and continues to do so today,
  in logos, sports teams, and many other contexts. It’s my opinion that, while this is perhaps a
  less scientific approach, it’s much more creative, fun, and colourful. Surely this is at least
  part of the reason why so many people have an interest in their astrological and Chinese signs. I
  also believe that this naming system will help to introduce people to many new constellations,
  other than the well-known 12 of the zodiac.</p>

<p>The mathematics of the calendar is the science part; the names are the art. As I said to Tom back
  when we decided to align the calendars, it’s the maths that matters; the names of months and sols
  of the week are just the paint job. The Martians may come up with different names for their
  months, but I hope they will like these.</p>

<p>The names have been ordered by right ascension of the constellations.</p>

<p>The abbreviations for each month name is not always the first 3 letters of the name, as in the
  Gregorian Calendar; rather, the standard IAU 3-letter abbreviation for the constellation is used.
  The abbreviations <i>Aql</i>, <i>Phe</i>, <i>Hya</i>, <i>Crv</i>, and <i>Aps</i> are the only
  abbreviations that do not match the first 3 letters of the name.</p>
